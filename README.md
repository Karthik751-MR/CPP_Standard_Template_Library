Of course. It's a pleasure to guide you through the C++ Standard Template Library. The STL is a cornerstone of modern C++, and mastering it will significantly elevate your programming skills. We'll start with the simplest sequential container, `std::array`, and build our knowledge from there, covering every detail as you requested.

Let's begin.

### `std::array` - The Fixed-Size Powerhouse

#### Introduction

`std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed-size arrays. Introduced in C++11, it's a wrapper around a C-style static array that provides the benefits of an STL container, such as iterators, size information, and bounds-checked access, without any overhead.

  * **Purpose:** To provide a safer, more feature-rich alternative to built-in C-style arrays.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Fixed Size:** The size of a `std::array` is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed. The size is part of its type. For example, `std::array<int, 5>` and `std::array<int, 10>` are two completely different types.
      * **Memory:** Typically allocated on the stack, just like a C-style array, making it very fast. There's no dynamic memory allocation involved.
      * **Aggregate Type:** It's an aggregate type, which allows for aggregate initialization using curly braces `{}`.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Element Access:** $O(1)$ - Constant time.
      * **Iteration:** $O(N)$ - Linear in the number of elements.
      * **`fill()` / `swap()`:** $O(N)$ - Linear time.
  * **When to Use `std::array`:**
      * When you know the size of your collection at compile time.
      * When you need a small, fixed-size collection of elements and want to avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation (e.g., coordinates, a small lookup table, a buffer).
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. C-style array (`int arr[5]`):** `std::array` is almost always better. It knows its own size (`.size()`), can be easily copied or assigned, provides iterators for use with STL algorithms, and offers optional bounds-checking (`.at()`). It has zero size overhead.
      * **vs. `std::vector`:** `std::vector` is a dynamic array; its size can change at runtime. It manages its memory on the heap. Use `std::vector` when the size of the collection is unknown at compile time or needs to change. Use `std::array` for fixed-size collections for better performance and stack allocation.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::array`, you must include the `<array>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::array<T, N> array_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the array will hold (e.g., `int`, `double`, `std::string`).
  * `N`: The number of elements in the array. This must be a compile-time constant.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A std::array of 5 integers
    std::array<int, 5> my_integers;

    // A std::array of 10 strings
    std::array<std::string, 10> my_strings;

    // A std::array of 3 doubles
    std::array<double, 3> my_doubles;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::array objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Constructors and Initialization

`std::array` is an aggregate type, so its initialization follows the rules of aggregate initialization.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <string>
#include <numeric> // For std::to_array (C++20)

// Helper function to print arrays
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
void print_array(const std::string& name, const std::array<T, N>& arr) {
    std::cout << name << ": { ";
    for (const auto& elem : arr) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Note: 'using namespace std;' is used here for brevity in the example.
    // In larger projects, it's better to use 'std::' prefixes.
    using namespace std;

    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Initialization (leaves elements with indeterminate values for fundamental types)
    array<int, 5> arr1; // arr1 contains garbage values.
    // print_array("1. Default initialized (arr1)", arr1); // Don't print, values are indeterminate.

    // 2. Value Initialization / Zero Initialization (C++11)
    // Using an empty initializer list initializes all elements to their default value (0 for int).
    array<int, 5> arr2{}; // All elements are 0.
    print_array("2. Value initialized (arr2)", arr2);

    array<int, 5> arr3 = {}; // Equivalent to the above.
    print_array("3. Value initialized (arr3)", arr3);

    // 4. Aggregate Initialization with an Initializer List
    array<int, 5> arr4 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    print_array("4. Aggregate initialized (arr4)", arr4);

    // 5. Partial Aggregate Initialization
    // Elements not in the list are value-initialized (to 0).
    array<int, 5> arr5 = {11, 22}; // arr5 will be {11, 22, 0, 0, 0}
    print_array("5. Partial aggregate init (arr5)", arr5);

    // 6. Copy Initialization
    array<int, 5> arr6 = arr4; // arr6 is a copy of arr4.
    print_array("6. Copy initialized (arr6 from arr4)", arr6);

    // 7. Move Initialization (C++11)
    // For std::array of fundamental types, this is typically the same as a copy.
    // For arrays of objects with move semantics (like std::string), it would be more efficient.
    array<int, 5> arr7 = std::move(arr6);
    print_array("7. Move initialized (arr7 from arr6)", arr7);
    // After move, arr6 is in a valid but unspecified state. Let's re-initialize it to be safe.
    arr6.fill(0);
    print_array("   (arr6 after move and fill)", arr6);
    
    // 8. std::to_array (C++20)
    // Deduces the type and size automatically from a built-in array or initializer list.
    auto arr8 = std::to_array({1, 2, 3, 4}); // Type is std::array<int, 4>
    cout << "8. From std::to_array: { ";
    for (const auto& elem : arr8) cout << elem << " ";
    cout << "}" << endl;
    
    auto arr9 = std::to_array("Hi"); // Type is std::array<char, 3> (includes null terminator)
    cout << "9. From std::to_array(\"Hi\"): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : arr9) cout << "'" << elem << "' ";
    cout << "}" << endl;


    return 0;
}
```

#### Assignment and Access

Here are the various ways to assign new values to an array and access its elements.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <stdexcept> // For std::out_of_range

int main() {
    using namespace std;

    cout << "--- Assignment and Access ---" << endl;

    array<int, 5> arr1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    array<int, 5> arr2;

    // --- Assignment ---
    // 1. Copy Assignment Operator (=)
    arr2 = arr1; // Copies all elements from arr1 to arr2.
    cout << "1. arr2 after copy assignment: ";
    for (const auto& val : arr2) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;

    // 2. Move Assignment Operator (=)
    array<int, 5> arr3;
    arr3 = std::move(arr1); // Moves content from arr1 to arr3.
    cout << "2. arr3 after move assignment: ";
    for (const auto& val : arr3) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;
    // arr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state.

    // --- Access Methods ---
    cout << "\n--- Accessing elements of arr2: {20, 30, 40, 50, 60} ---" << endl;
    arr2 = {20, 30, 40, 50, 60};

    // 3. Subscript operator []
    // Fastest access, but performs NO bounds checking.
    int val_at_1 = arr2[1]; // Access the second element (30)
    cout << "3. Element at index 1 using []: " << val_at_1 << endl;
    arr2[4] = 65; // Modify the last element
    cout << "   arr2 after modification: arr2[4] = " << arr2[4] << endl;
    // arr2[10] = 100; // Undefined Behavior! Can crash or corrupt memory.

    // 4. at() member function
    // Slower than [], but performs bounds checking. Throws std::out_of_range on error.
    int val_at_2 = arr2.at(2); // Access the third element (40)
    cout << "4. Element at index 2 using at(): " << val_at_2 << endl;
    try {
        int val_at_10 = arr2.at(10); // This will throw an exception
    } catch (const out_of_range& e) {
        cout << "   Caught exception when calling at(10): " << e.what() << endl;
    }

    // 5. front() member function
    // Direct access to the first element (arr2[0]).
    cout << "5. First element using front(): " << arr2.front() << endl;

    // 6. back() member function
    // Direct access to the last element (arr2[size - 1]).
    cout << "6. Last element using back(): " << arr2.back() << endl;

    // 7. data() member function
    // Returns a raw pointer to the underlying C-style array.
    // Useful for interoperability with C functions.
    int* p_data = arr2.data();
    cout << "7. Element at index 3 via data(): " << *(p_data + 3) << endl; // *(p_data + 3) is equivalent to arr2[3]

    // 8. std::get<I> (non-member function)
    // Access element using a compile-time constant index.
    cout << "8. Element at compile-time index 0 via std::get: " << std::get<0>(arr2) << endl;
    // std::get<5>(arr2); // This would be a COMPILE-TIME error, which is great.

    return 0;
}
```

#### All Member Functions and Methods

`std::array` has a small but powerful set of member functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <iterator> // For std::size

int main() {
    using namespace std;

    cout << "--- All Member Functions ---" << endl;

    array<char, 6> letters = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'};
    array<char, 6> other_letters = {'x', 'y', 'z', 'p', 'q', 'r'};

    // --- Iterators ---
    // begin(): returns an iterator to the beginning.
    // end(): returns an iterator to one past the end.
    cout << "Iterating with begin() and end(): ";
    for (auto it = letters.begin(); it != letters.end(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // cbegin(), cend(): const versions of begin/end.
    cout << "Iterating with cbegin() and cend(): ";
    for (auto it = letters.cbegin(); it != letters.cend(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
        // *it = 'z'; // Compile error: iterator is const
    }
    cout << endl;

    // rbegin(), rend(): reverse iterators.
    cout << "Reverse iterating with rbegin() and rend(): ";
    for (auto it = letters.rbegin(); it != letters.rend(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // crbegin(), crend(): const reverse iterators.
    cout << "Reverse iterating with crbegin() and crend(): ";
    for (auto it = letters.crbegin(); it != letters.crend(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // --- Capacity ---
    // empty(): checks if the container is empty. Returns true if N == 0.
    array<int, 5> non_empty_arr;
    array<int, 0> empty_arr;
    cout << "\nletters.empty(): " << boolalpha << letters.empty() << endl; // false
    cout << "empty_arr.empty(): " << boolalpha << empty_arr.empty() << endl; // true

    // size(): returns the number of elements (N).
    cout << "letters.size(): " << letters.size() << endl; // 6
    cout << "empty_arr.size(): " << empty_arr.size() << endl; // 0
    // std::size() (C++17) is a non-member function that also works.
    cout << "std::size(letters): " << std::size(letters) << endl;

    // max_size(): returns the maximum possible number of elements. For std::array, this is always equal to size().
    cout << "letters.max_size(): " << letters.max_size() << endl; // 6

    // --- Modifiers ---
    // fill(): assigns a given value to all elements in the container.
    cout << "\nBefore fill, letters: ";
    for (char c : letters) cout << c << " ";
    cout << endl;
    letters.fill('z');
    cout << "After letters.fill('z'): ";
    for (char c : letters) cout << c << " ";
    cout << endl;

    // swap(): exchanges the content of two arrays.
    // The two arrays must be of the same type and size.
    cout << "\nBefore swap:" << endl;
    cout << "  letters: "; for (char c : letters) cout << c << " "; cout << endl;
    cout << "  other_letters: "; for (char c : other_letters) cout << c << " "; cout << endl;
    
    letters.swap(other_letters);
    
    cout << "After swap:" << endl;
    cout << "  letters: "; for (char c : letters) cout << c << " "; cout << endl;
    cout << "  other_letters: "; for (char c : other_letters) cout << " "; cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Iterators and Algorithms

The real power of `std::array` over C-style arrays is its seamless integration with the STL algorithms found in the `<algorithm>` and `<numeric>` headers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm> // for std::sort, std::find, std::for_each
#include <numeric>   // for std::accumulate

int main() {
    using namespace std;

    cout << "--- Iterators and Algorithms ---" << endl;

    array<int, 8> nums = {50, 20, 80, 10, 40, 70, 60, 30};

    // 1. Using a range-based for loop (syntactic sugar for iterators)
    cout << "Original array: ";
    for (const int& num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // 2. Sorting the array using std::sort
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (const int& num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // 3. Finding an element using std::find
    int value_to_find = 40;
    auto it_found = find(nums.begin(), nums.end(), value_to_find);

    if (it_found != nums.end()) {
        // distance can calculate the index from the iterator
        cout << "Value " << value_to_find << " found at index: " << distance(nums.begin(), it_found) << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Value " << value_to_find << " not found." << endl;
    }
    
    // 4. Using std::for_each with a lambda to modify elements
    cout << "Array after adding 100 to each element: ";
    for_each(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](int& n){ n += 100; });
    for (const int& num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // 5. Using std::accumulate to sum all elements
    int sum = accumulate(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), 0);
    cout << "Sum of all elements: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Operators

`std::array` supports all relational operators, which perform a lexicographical comparison.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << boolalpha; // Print bools as true/false

    cout << "--- Operators ---" << endl;

    array<int, 4> a1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    array<int, 4> a2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    array<int, 4> a3 = {1, 2, 4, 0};
    array<int, 4> a4 = {5, 0, 0, 0};

    // operator==
    cout << "a1 == a2: " << (a1 == a2) << endl; // true
    cout << "a1 == a3: " << (a1 == a3) << endl; // false

    // operator!=
    cout << "a1 != a3: " << (a1 != a3) << endl; // true

    // operator< (lexicographical comparison)
    // Compares element by element.
    // a1 vs a3: 1==1, 2==2, 3<4, so a1 < a3 is true.
    cout << "a1 < a3: " << (a1 < a3) << endl; // true
    // a3 vs a4: 1<5, so a3 < a4 is true.
    cout << "a3 < a4: " << (a3 < a4) << endl; // true

    // operator>
    cout << "a4 > a1: " << (a4 > a1) << endl; // true

    // operator<=
    cout << "a1 <= a2: " << (a1 <= a2) << endl; // true
    cout << "a1 <= a3: " << (a1 <= a3) << endl; // true

    // operator>=
    cout << "a1 >= a2: " << (a1 >= a2) << endl; // true
    cout << "a4 >= a3: " << (a4 >= a3) << endl; // true

    // operator<=> (C++20, three-way comparison "spaceship operator")
    #if __cplusplus >= 202002L
        cout << "\n--- C++20 Spaceship Operator ---" << endl;
        auto result1 = (a1 <=> a3); // a1 is less than a3
        if (result1 < 0) cout << "a1 <=> a3 is less (as expected)" << endl;
        
        auto result2 = (a1 <=> a2); // a1 is equal to a2
        if (result2 == 0) cout << "a1 <=> a2 is equal (as expected)" << endl;
        
        auto result3 = (a4 <=> a1); // a4 is greater than a1
        if (result3 > 0) cout << "a4 <=> a1 is greater (as expected)" << endl;
    #endif

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Examples and Edge Cases

Let's explore some interesting edge cases.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    using namespace std;

    cout << "--- Examples and Edge Cases ---" << endl;

    // Edge Case 1: Zero-sized array
    array<float, 0> zero_arr;
    cout << "Size of zero_arr: " << zero_arr.size() << endl;       // 0
    cout << "Is zero_arr empty? " << boolalpha << zero_arr.empty() << endl; // true
    cout << "zero_arr.begin() == zero_arr.end(): " << (zero_arr.begin() == zero_arr.end()) << endl; // true
    // float* p = zero_arr.data(); // This is valid, p will be a unique non-dereferenceable pointer.
    // *p = 1.0f; // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR. Do not dereference data() from a zero-sized array.

    // Edge Case 2: Array of non-primitive types
    struct Point { int x, y; };
    array<Point, 3> points = { {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}} }; // Note the nested braces
    cout << "\nSecond point's x coordinate: " << points[1].x << endl;

    // Edge Case 3: Bounds checking `at()` vs `[]`
    array<int, 4> small_arr = {100, 200, 300, 400};
    cout << "\nAttempting out-of-bounds access..." << endl;
    try {
        cout << "Accessing small_arr.at(4)... ";
        int val = small_arr.at(4); // Throws std::out_of_range
        cout << val << endl;
    } catch (const out_of_range& e) {
        cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }

    // This next line is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR. It might crash, it might print garbage,
    // or it might seem to work by accessing adjacent memory. Do not do this.
    // cout << "Accessing small_arr[4]... " << small_arr[4] << endl;

    // Edge Case 4: `std::array` can be a template parameter itself
    // A 2D array (array of arrays)
    constexpr int ROWS = 2;
    constexpr int COLS = 3;
    array<array<int, COLS>, ROWS> matrix = {{{{1, 2, 3}}, {{4, 5, 6}}}};
    cout << "\n2D Matrix element at (1, 2): " << matrix[1][2] << endl; // 6
    cout << "Using at(): " << matrix.at(1).at(2) << endl; // 6

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Prefer `std::array` over C-style arrays:** Always use `std::array<T, N>` instead of `T arr[N]` in modern C++. You get type safety, iterators, and a standard container interface for free.
  * **Pass by Reference:** `std::array` is passed by value by default, meaning the entire array is copied. For large arrays, this is inefficient. Pass them by reference (`const std::array<T, N>&` for read-only access) or by r-value reference (`std::array<T, N>&&` for moves).
  * **Always Initialize:** A default-constructed `std::array<int, N> arr;` contains uninitialized (garbage) values. Always use list initialization (`{}`) to ensure elements are value-initialized, e.g., `std::array<int, N> arr{};`.
  * **Use `constexpr` for Size:** When possible, define the size of your array with a `constexpr` variable. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
    ```cpp
    constexpr size_t NumElements = 10;
    std::array<int, NumElements> my_data;
    ```
  * **Use `at()` for Debugging:** During development and debugging, using `.at()` can help you catch out-of-bounds errors early. For performance-critical release builds, you can switch to `[]` if you are certain your indices are valid.
  * **Use `std::to_array` (C++20):** If you are working with C++20 or later, `std::to_array` is a convenient and safe way to create an array while letting the compiler deduce its type and size.
  * **Competitive Programming:** `std::array` is excellent for small, fixed-size data structures like frequency counts for characters (`std::array<int, 26>`), small lookup tables, or coordinates, where performance and stack allocation are key.

-----

We have now covered `std::array` in exhaustive detail. It's a simple but fundamental building block. With this solid foundation, you are ready to move on to the next topic.

Next, we will explore `std::pair`, a simple but incredibly useful utility that holds two heterogeneous objects.

Excellent. Let's proceed.

After understanding `std::array`, which handles a fixed number of elements of the same type, it's logical to look at a utility that handles a fixed number of elements (specifically, two) of potentially *different* types. This brings us to `std::pair`.

-----

### `std::pair` - The Two-in-One Utility

#### Introduction

`std::pair` is not a container in the traditional sense like `std::array` or `std::vector`. It is a simple class template defined in the `<utility>` header that holds exactly two public data members, named `first` and `second`. These two members can be of different types.

  * **Purpose:** To group two heterogeneous objects into a single unit. It's a fundamental building block in the STL.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Heterogeneous:** The types of the two elements (`T1` and `T2`) can be different.
      * **Fixed Size:** It always holds exactly two elements.
      * **Direct Access:** Members are accessed directly via public member variables `p.first` and `p.second`.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * All operations (construction, destruction, copy, move, access) are $O(1)$ - Constant time.
  * **When to Use `std::pair`:**
      * When a function needs to return two values (e.g., a result and an error code, or a minimum and maximum value).
      * As the `value_type` for associative containers like `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` to store key-value pairs.
      * For any simple, generic grouping of two related pieces of data.
  * **Comparison to Similar Constructs:**
      * **vs. `std::tuple`:** `std::tuple` is a generalization of `std::pair`. A tuple can hold any number of elements (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). `std::pair` is essentially a `std::tuple` specialized for two elements and is often simpler to use for that common case.
      * **vs. `struct`:** You could always define your own `struct` (e.g., `struct Point { int x; int y; };`). This is often more readable and self-documenting. Use a `struct` when the members have clear, specific meanings. Use `std::pair` for more generic, "on-the-fly" groupings where the names `first` and `second` are sufficient.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::pair`, you must include the `<utility>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::pair<T1, T2> pair_name;`

  * `T1`: The type of the first element.
  * `T2`: The type of the second element.

    std::pair<std::string, char> p2;
    
    // A pair of two strings
    std::pair<std::string, std::string> p3;

    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::pair objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

#### Constructors and Initialization

`std::pair` offers several ways to be constructed and initialized.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <string>
#include <complex> // For a more complex type example
#include <tuple>   // For std::piecewise_construct

// Helper function to print pairs
template<typename T1, typename T2>
void print_pair(const std::string& name, const std::pair<T1, T2>& p) {
    std::cout << name << ": { " << p.first << ", " << p.second << " }" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    // Value-initializes members. For fundamental types, this means zero-initialization.
    pair<int, double> p1; // p1.first is 0, p1.second is 0.0
    print_pair("1. Default constructed", p1);

    // 2. Initialization Constructor
    // Initializes 'first' with the first argument and 'second' with the second.
    pair<int, string> p2(10, "hello");
    print_pair("2. Initialized", p2);

    // 3. Copy Constructor
    pair<int, string> p3(p2); // p3 is a copy of p2
    print_pair("3. Copy constructed", p3);

    // 4. Move Constructor (C++11)
    // Moves the content from the source pair's members.
    pair<int, string> p4(std::move(p2));
    print_pair("4. Move constructed", p4);
    // After move, p2 is in a valid but unspecified state.
    cout << "   (p2 after move): { " << p2.first << ", \"" << p2.second << "\" }" << std::endl;

    // 5. Converting Constructor
    // Can construct from a pair with different (but convertible) types.
    pair<long, const char*> p5_source(100L, "world");
    pair<int, string> p5(p5_source);
    print_pair("5. Converting constructed", p5);

    // 6. std::make_pair() helper function
    // Deduces the types of the elements automatically.
    auto p6 = std::make_pair(200, 3.14f); // Type is pair<int, float>
    print_pair("6. With std::make_pair", p6);

    // 7. Aggregate Initialization (C++11 and later)
    // Often the clearest and most concise way.
    pair<string, bool> p7 = {"C++11", true};
    print_pair("7. Aggregate initialized", p7);

    // 8. Piecewise Construction (C++11) (Rarely used, but powerful)
    // Constructs the 'first' and 'second' members in-place using arguments
    // provided in tuples. Useful for types that don't have cheap copy/move constructors.
    // The first tuple's elements are for the first member's constructor, and so on.
    // std::complex has a constructor complex(double, double). std::string has a constructor string(size_t, char).
    pair<string, complex<double>> p8(
        piecewise_construct,                    // Tag to select this constructor
        make_tuple(5, 'a'),                     // Arguments for string's constructor -> string(5, 'a') -> "aaaaa"
        make_tuple(1.0, -1.0)                   // Arguments for complex's constructor -> complex(1.0, -1.0)
    );
    cout << "8. Piecewise constructed: { " << p8.first << ", " << p8.second << " }" << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Assignment and Access

Assigning values to and accessing members of a `std::pair` is straightforward.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Assignment and Access ---" << endl;

    pair<int, string> p1(1, "one");
    pair<int, string> p2(2, "two");

    // --- Assignment ---
    // 1. Copy Assignment
    p2 = p1;
    cout << "1. p2 after copy assignment: { " << p2.first << ", " << p2.second << " }" << endl;

    // 2. Move Assignment
    pair<int, string> p3;
    p3 = std::move(p1);
    cout << "2. p3 after move assignment: { " << p3.first << ", " << p3.second << " }" << endl;
    cout << "   (p1 after move): { " << p1.first << ", \"" << p1.second << "\" }" << endl;

    // --- Access ---
    cout << "\n--- Accessing elements of p3 = {1, \"one\"} ---" << endl;
    
    // 3. Direct member access .first and .second
    cout << "3. Access via .first: " << p3.first << endl;
    cout << "   Access via .second: " << p3.second << endl;
    // Members can also be modified directly
    p3.first = 100;
    cout << "   After modification: p3.first = " << p3.first << endl;

    // 4. std::get<I> (non-member function)
    // Can access by a compile-time index (0 for first, 1 for second).
    cout << "4. Access via std::get<0>: " << std::get<0>(p3) << endl;
    cout << "   Access via std::get<1>: " << std::get<1>(p3) << endl;
    // std::get<2>(p3); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR

    // 5. Structured Bindings (C++17)
    // The most elegant way to unpack a pair into separate variables.
    auto p4 = make_pair(2025, "August");
    cout << "\n--- Structured Bindings (C++17) ---" << endl;
    auto [year, month] = p4; // Declares 'year' and 'month' and initializes them from p4
    cout << "5. Unpacked via structured binding: year = " << year << ", month = " << month << endl;
    
    // You can also use const& to avoid copies
    const auto& [const_year, const_month] = p4;
    cout << "   Unpacked with const&: year = " << const_year << ", month = " << const_month << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Member and Non-Member Functions

`std::pair` itself has very few member functions. Most of its utility comes from non-member functions in `<utility>`.

| Category       | Function/Method                  | Description                                                                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Member** | `(constructor)`                  | Constructs the pair.                                                            |
|                | `(destructor)`                   | Destroys the pair.                                                              |

|                | relational operators             | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.                                                |
|                | `std::operator<=>` (C++20)       | Three-way comparison.                                                           |

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Member and Non-Member Functions ---" << endl;
    
    pair<int, string> p1(1, "apple");
    pair<int, string> p2(2, "banana");

    cout << "Initial p1: { " << p1.first << ", " << p1.second << " }" << endl;
    cout << "Initial p2: { " << p2.first << ", " << p2.second << " }" << endl;
    
    // 1. Member swap()
    p1.swap(p2);
    
    cout << "\nAfter p1.swap(p2):" << endl;
    cout << "  p1: { " << p1.first << ", " << p1.second << " }" << endl;
    cout << "  p2: { " << p2.first << ", " << p2.second << " }" << endl;
    
    // 2. Non-member std::swap()
    // Swaps them back
    std::swap(p1, p2);
    
    cout << "\nAfter std::swap(p1, p2):" << endl;
    cout << "  p1: { " << p1.first << ", " << p1.second << " }" << endl;
    cout << "  p2: { " << p2.first << ", " << p2.second << " }" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}

#### Iterators and Algorithms

`std::pair` is **not a container**. It does not hold a sequence of elements. It is a single object that happens to contain two members. Therefore:

  * It does **not** have iterators (`.begin()`, `.end()`, etc.).
  * STL algorithms that operate on ranges of elements (like `std::sort`, `std::find`, `std::for_each`) **cannot** be used on a `std::pair` directly. You can, of course, have a container *of* pairs (e.g., `std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>`) and apply algorithms to that container.

-----

#### Operators

Relational operators for `std::pair` work by first comparing the `.first` members. If they are equal, the `.second` members are then compared. This is a form of lexicographical comparison.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << boolalpha;

    cout << "--- Operators ---" << endl;
    
    pair<int, string> p1(10, "cat");
    pair<int, string> p2(10, "dog");
    pair<int, string> p3(20, "bird");
    pair<int, string> p4(10, "cat");

    // operator== and operator!=
    cout << "p1 == p4: " << (p1 == p4) << endl; // true (both members are equal)
    cout << "p1 == p2: " << (p1 == p2) << endl; // false (second members differ)
    cout << "p1 != p2: " << (p1 != p2) << endl; // true
    
    // operator<
    // p1 vs p2: first members (10 vs 10) are equal. Compare second: "cat" < "dog" is true.
    cout << "p1 < p2: " << (p1 < p2) << endl; // true
    // p2 vs p3: first members (10 vs 20). 10 < 20 is true. Second member is not checked.
    cout << "p2 < p3: " << (p2 < p3) << endl; // true

    // other operators follow the same logic
    cout << "p3 > p1: " << (p3 > p1) << endl; // true
    cout << "p1 <= p4: " << (p1 <= p4) << endl; // true

    // operator<=> (C++20)
    #if __cplusplus >= 202002L
        cout << "\n--- C++20 Spaceship Operator ---" << endl;
        // p1 is less than p2 because .second is lexicographically smaller
        auto res1 = (p1 <=> p2);
        if (res1 < 0) cout << "p1 <=> p2 is less (as expected)" << endl;

        // p3 is greater than p2 because .first is larger
        auto res2 = (p3 <=> p2);
        if (res2 > 0) cout << "p3 <=> p2 is greater (as expected)" << endl;

        // p1 and p4 are equivalent
        auto res3 = (p1 <=> p4);
        if (res3 == 0) cout << "p1 <=> p4 is equivalent (as expected)" << endl;
    #endif

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Examples and Edge Cases

Here are some practical examples and interesting cases involving `std::pair`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::minmax_element

// Example 1: Function returning a pair
std::pair<int, int> find_min_max(const std::vector<int>& data) {
    if (data.empty()) {
        return {0, 0}; // Return a default pair for empty input
    }
    const auto [min_it, max_it] = std::minmax_element(data.begin(), data.end());
    return {*min_it, *max_it};
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Examples and Edge Cases ---" << endl;

    // 1. Returning a pair from a function
    vector<int> numbers = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6};
    auto min_max_pair = find_min_max(numbers);
    cout << "1. Min: " << min_max_pair.first << ", Max: " << min_max_pair.second << endl;

    // Using structured bindings to receive the return value
    auto [min_val, max_val] = find_min_max(numbers);
    cout << "   Received with structured bindings: Min = " << min_val << ", Max = " << max_val << endl;

    // 2. A vector of pairs
    vector<pair<string, int>> student_scores;
    student_scores.push_back({"Alice", 95});
    student_scores.push_back(make_pair("Bob", 88));
    student_scores.emplace_back("Charlie", 92); // More efficient

    cout << "\n2. Student Scores:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [name, score] : student_scores) {
        cout << "   - " << name << ": " << score << endl;
    }
    
    // 3. Edge Case: Pair with a reference member
    string name = "Gemini";
    int version = 1;
    pair<string&, int> ref_pair(name, version); // The first member is a REFERENCE to 'name'
    
    cout << "\n3. Pair with a reference:" << endl;
    cout << "   Original name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "   Pair's first member: " << ref_pair.first << endl;
    
    ref_pair.first = "Gemini Advanced"; // Modifying the pair's member...
    
    cout << "   ...modifies the original variable -> Original name: " << name << endl;
    
    // 4. Pair of pairs (nesting)
    pair<string, pair<int, int>> item_location;
    item_location.first = "Laptop";
    item_location.second.first = 3;   // row
    item_location.second.second = 5;  // column
    
    cout << "\n4. Nested pair: Item '" << item_location.first 
          << "' is at (" << item_location.second.first << ", " 
          << item_location.second.second << ")" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use Structured Bindings (C++17):** When reading from a pair, prefer structured bindings (`auto [a, b] = my_pair;`) over accessing `.first` and `.second` individually. It is more readable, less verbose, and reduces errors.
  * **`struct` for Clarity:** If the two elements you are grouping have a clear, semantic meaning (like `x` and `y` coordinates), define a `struct` with named members. It makes your code self-documenting. Use `std::pair` for generic, lightweight groupings.
    ```cpp
    // Good: a struct for clarity
    struct Point { double x; double y; };
    Point p = {1.0, 2.0};

    // Good: a pair for generic key-value
    std::pair<std::string, int> config("retries", 3);
    ```
  * **Understand Its Role in `std::map`:** `std::pair` is the cornerstone of C++'s map-like containers. A `std::map<Key, Value>` is a container of `std::pair<const Key, Value>`. Understanding `std::pair` well is essential before you tackle maps.
  * **`std::make_pair` vs. Braces `{}`:** In modern C++, aggregate initialization with braces (`pair<int, string> p = {1, "hi"};`) is often cleaner. `std::make_pair` is still useful in contexts where type deduction is needed, like passing a temporary pair to a function.

-----

`std::pair` is a simple yet indispensable utility. It forms the conceptual basis for key-value structures that we will see later.

Now that we understand how to group two items, let's move on to our first fully *dynamic* sequence container: `std::vector`. It is arguably the most important and commonly used container in the entire STL.

Absolutely. Let's dive into `std::vector`, the most ubiquitous and versatile container in the C++ Standard Template Library.

-----

### `std::vector` - The Dynamic Array

#### Introduction

`std::vector` is a sequence container that represents a dynamic array. It can grow and shrink in size at runtime, automatically managing the memory for its elements. It's the default "go-to" container for holding a sequence of objects in C++.

  * **Purpose:** To provide a flexible array-like data structure whose size can change dynamically.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Dynamic Size:** Unlike `std::array`, a `std::vector`'s size is not fixed at compile time. You can add (`push_back`) or remove (`pop_back`, `erase`) elements at will.
      * **Contiguous Memory:** This is a crucial feature. All elements in a `std::vector` are stored in a single, contiguous block of memory. This allows for fast random access (just like a C-style array) and provides excellent cache performance.
      * **Automatic Memory Management:** The vector handles all memory allocations and deallocations. When it runs out of space, it allocates a larger block of memory and moves the elements, a process called *reallocation*.
      * **Size vs. Capacity:** A `vector` has a `size` (the number of elements it currently holds) and a `capacity` (the number of elements it *can* hold before needing to reallocate memory). `capacity() >= size()`. This design is what makes adding elements efficient on average.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Random Access** (`[]`, `at()`): $O(1)$ - Constant time.
      * **Adding/Removing at the End** (`push_back`, `pop_back`): Amortized $O(1)$. It's usually constant time, but occasionally it becomes $O(N)$ when a reallocation is required. Over many operations, the average time is constant.
      * **Adding/Removing at the Beginning or Middle** (`insert`, `erase`): $O(N)$ - Linear time, because all subsequent elements must be shifted.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::array`:** Use `std::array` when you know the size at compile-time and it will never change. Use `std::vector` for all other cases where you need a dynamic array.
      * **vs. `std::deque`:** `std::vector` guarantees contiguous memory, while `std::deque` does not. `std::vector` has slightly faster element access. However, `std::deque` provides fast $O(1)$ insertion and deletion at both the front and the back, whereas `std::vector` is only fast at the back.
      * **vs. `std::list`:** Use `std::vector` when you need fast random access. Use `std::list` when you need to perform frequent insertions and deletions in the middle of the sequence, as this is $O(1)$ for a list (if you have an iterator) but $O(N)$ for a vector.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::vector`, you must include the `<vector>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::vector<T, Allocator> vector_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the vector will hold.
  * `Allocator`: An optional parameter for custom memory allocation, which is an advanced topic. You will almost always omit it.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A vector of integers
    std::vector<int> int_vec;

    // A vector of strings
    std::vector<std::string> string_vec;

    // A vector of pairs
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> pair_vec;

    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::vector objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

`std::vector` provides a rich set of constructors for various initialization scenarios.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Helper function to print vectors
template<typename T>
void print_vector(const std::string& name, const std::vector<T>& vec) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << vec.size() << ", cap=" << vec.capacity() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : vec) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    // Creates an empty vector with size 0 and capacity 0.
    vector<int> v1;
    print_vector("1. Default", v1);

    // 2. Fill Constructor (with size)
    // Creates a vector with 'n' elements, which are value-initialized (0 for int).
    vector<int> v2(5); // 5 integers, all initialized to 0
    print_vector("2. Fill (size)", v2);

    // 3. Fill Constructor (with size and value)
    // Creates a vector with 'n' elements, each a copy of the given value.
    vector<int> v3(5, 100); // 5 integers, all initialized to 100
    print_vector("3. Fill (size and value)", v3);

    // 4. Range Constructor
    // Creates a vector from a range defined by two iterators.
    vector<int> v4(v3.begin(), v3.begin() + 3); // Copies the first 3 elements of v3
    print_vector("4. Range", v4);

    // 5. Copy Constructor
    // Creates a new vector that is a copy of an existing one.
    vector<int> v5(v4);
    print_vector("5. Copy", v5);

    // 6. Move Constructor (C++11)
    // "Steals" the resources from the source vector, which is much more efficient than a copy.
    // The source vector is left in a valid but empty or unspecified state.
    vector<int> v6(std::move(v5));
    print_vector("6. Move", v6);
    print_vector("   (v5 after move)", v5);

    // 7. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    // The most common and convenient way to initialize a vector with known values.
    vector<int> v7 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    print_vector("7. Initializer list", v7);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Assignment and Access

Here are the ways to assign values to a vector after its creation and to access its elements.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    using namespace std;

    cout << "--- Assignment and Access ---" << endl;
    vector<int> vec1 = {10, 20, 30};
    vector<int> vec2;

    // --- Assignment ---
    // 1. Copy Assignment Operator (=)
    vec2 = vec1;
    cout << "1. vec2 after copy assignment: ";
    for(int val : vec2) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;

    // 2. Move Assignment Operator (=)
    vector<int> vec3;
    vec3 = std::move(vec1);
    cout << "2. vec3 after move assignment: ";
    for(int val : vec3) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;

    // 3. Initializer List Assignment (C++11)
    vec3 = {100, 200, 300, 400};
    cout << "3. vec3 after initializer list assignment: ";
    for(int val : vec3) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;

    // 4. assign() method
    // Replaces the entire content of the vector.
    vector<int> vec4;
    vec4.assign(5, 99); // Fill version: 5 elements, all with value 99
    cout << "4. vec4 after assign(5, 99): ";
    for(int val : vec4) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;
    
    vec4.assign(vec3.begin(), vec3.end()); // Range version
    cout << "   vec4 after assign from vec3 range: ";
    for(int val : vec4) cout << val << " ";
    cout << endl;

    return 0;

#### All Member Functions and Methods

This is where `std::vector` truly shines, with a rich API for managing capacity, elements, and iteration.

##### Capacity Functions

These functions manage the storage of the vector.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Capacity Functions ---" << endl;
    
    vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};
    cout << "Initial - size: " << vec.size() << ", capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;

    // empty(): checks if size is 0.
    cout << "vec.empty(): " << boolalpha << vec.empty() << endl; // false

    // size(): returns the number of elements.
    cout << "vec.size(): " << vec.size() << endl; // 3

    // max_size(): returns the maximum number of elements the vector can hold.
    // This is usually a very large number, dependent on the system architecture.
    cout << "vec.max_size(): " << vec.max_size() << endl;

    // reserve(): increases the capacity to a new value.
    // This is a key performance optimization to avoid reallocations.
    vec.reserve(100);
    cout << "After reserve(100) - size: " << vec.size() << ", capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;

    // capacity(): returns the current storage capacity.
    cout << "vec.capacity(): " << vec.capacity() << endl; // At least 100

    // shrink_to_fit() (C++11): requests to reduce capacity to fit the size.
    // The request is non-binding, but usually honored by implementations.
    vec.shrink_to_fit();
    cout << "After shrink_to_fit() - size: " << vec.size() << ", capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;

    // resize(): changes the number of elements (the size).
    // If new size > old size, new elements are value-initialized.
    vec.resize(10);
    cout << "After resize(10) - size: " << vec.size() << ", capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;
    cout << "  vec[5] = " << vec[5] << endl; // will be 0

    // If new size < old size, elements are destroyed.
    vec.resize(2);
    cout << "After resize(2) - size: " << vec.size() << ", capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

##### Modifier Functions

These functions modify the contents of the vector.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// A simple class to demonstrate emplace_back vs push_back
struct President {
    std::string name;
    int year;
    President(std::string n, int y) : name(std::move(n)), year(y) {
        std::cout << "  Constructing President " << name << std::endl;
    }
    President(const President& other) : name(other.name), year(other.year) {
        std::cout << "  Copying President " << name << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Modifier Functions ---" << endl;
    vector<int> vec = {10, 20, 30};

    // push_back(): adds an element to the end.
    vec.push_back(40);
    vec.push_back(50);
    
    // pop_back(): removes the last element.
    vec.pop_back();

    // insert(): inserts elements at a specified position.
    // This is an O(N) operation.
    auto it = vec.begin() + 1; // Iterator pointing to 20
    vec.insert(it, 15); // Insert a single element
    
    vector<int> to_insert = {98, 99};
    vec.insert(vec.end(), to_insert.begin(), to_insert.end()); // Insert a range

    cout << "Vector after modifications: ";
    for(int v : vec) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;

    // erase(): removes elements from a specified position or range.
    // Also O(N). Returns an iterator to the element after the last one removed.
    vec.erase(vec.begin()); // Erase the first element
    vec.erase(vec.begin() + 2, vec.begin() + 4); // Erase a range of elements

    cout << "Vector after erase: ";
    for(int v : vec) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;

    // clear(): removes all elements. Size becomes 0, but capacity is unchanged.
    vec.clear();
    cout << "After clear() - size: " << vec.size() << ", capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;
    
    // emplace() and emplace_back() (C++11)
    // Construct elements in-place, avoiding unnecessary copies.
    cout << "\n--- emplace_back vs push_back ---" << endl;
    vector<President> presidents;
    presidents.reserve(2);

    cout << "push_back:" << endl;
    President p1("Washington", 1789); // Constructs p1
    presidents.push_back(p1);         // Copies p1 into the vector

    cout << "\nemplace_back:" << endl;
    // Constructs the President object directly inside the vector's memory. No temporary object is created.
    presidents.emplace_back("Adams", 1797);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Iterators and Algorithms

Like `std::array`, `std::vector` fully supports iterators, making it compatible with all STL algorithms.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::sort, std::remove
#include <numeric>   // for std::accumulate

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterators and Algorithms ---" << endl;
    vector<int> vec = {4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 6, 3};

    // Standard iteration
    cout << "Original vector: ";
    for(auto it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Sorting
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    cout << "Sorted vector: ";
    for(int v : vec) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;

    // Summing
    int sum = accumulate(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 0);
    cout << "Sum of elements: " << sum << endl;
    
    // The Erase-Remove Idiom
    // A classic C++ pattern to remove all occurrences of a value.
    // std::remove shifts all elements that are NOT the value to the front of the vector.
    // It returns an iterator to the new "logical" end of the vector.
    // The vector's size does not change, and the elements at the end are left in a valid but unspecified state.
    cout << "\n--- Erase-Remove Idiom (removing all 3s) ---" << endl;
    cout << "Vector before remove: ";
    for(int v : vec) cout << v << " "; cout << endl; // {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    
    auto new_end = std::remove(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3);
    
    cout << "Vector after std::remove (size is still " << vec.size() << "): ";
    for(int v : vec) cout << v << " "; cout << endl; // {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, ?, ?, ?}
    
    // The erase() method then physically removes the elements from the new logical end to the physical end.
    vec.erase(new_end, vec.end());

    cout << "Vector after erase: ";
    for(int v : vec) cout << v << " "; cout << endl; // {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
    cout << "Final size: " << vec.size() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Examples and Edge Cases

##### Reallocation and Iterator Invalidation

This is the most critical concept to understand when working with `std::vector`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Reallocation and Iterator Invalidation ---" << endl;
    
    vector<int> vec;
    cout << "Initial capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;
    
    // Store an iterator to the first element
    auto it = vec.begin();

    cout << "Adding elements..." << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        vec.push_back(i);
        cout << "Size: " << vec.size() << ", Capacity: " << vec.capacity() << endl;
        // When capacity changes, a reallocation has occurred.
        // ALL iterators, pointers, and references to elements are invalidated.
    }
    
    // it is now a dangling iterator. Accessing it is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.
    // cout << "Value pointed to by old iterator: " << *it << endl; // CRASH or garbage data
    
    cout << "\n--- Iterator Invalidation with erase() ---" << endl;
    vector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    // Incorrect way to erase elements in a loop
    // for (auto it_loop = nums.begin(); it_loop != nums.end(); ++it_loop) {
    //     if (*it_loop == 30) {
    //         nums.erase(it_loop); // Invalidates it_loop, loop breaks!
    //     }
    // }
    
    // Correct way: use the iterator returned by erase()
    for (auto it_loop = nums.begin(); it_loop != nums.end(); /* no increment here */) {
        if (*it_loop == 30) {
            it_loop = nums.erase(it_loop); // erase returns an iterator to the next element
        } else {
            ++it_loop; // only increment if we didn't erase
        }
    }
    
    cout << "Vector after erasing 30: ";
    for (int n : nums) cout << n << " "; cout << endl;

    ##### The `vector<bool>` Specialization
    // `vector<bool>` is a space-saving specialization where each "bool" is stored as a single bit.
    // It is NOT a standard container because its elements are not stored contiguously in memory.
    // You cannot take a pointer to an element like you can with other vectors.
    // Its iterators and element access (`operator[]`) return proxy objects, not `bool&`.
    
    vector<bool> bool_vec = {true, false, true};
    // bool* p = &bool_vec[0]; // COMPILE ERROR!
    auto first_val = bool_vec[0]; // first_val is not a bool&, but a proxy object
    first_val = false; // Modifies the vector via the proxy
    cout << "\n`vector<bool>` first element is now: " << boolalpha << bool_vec[0] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Prefer `std::vector` by Default:** When you need a sequence of items, `std::vector` should be your first choice unless you have a specific reason to use another container (e.g., you need fast insertions at the front, in which case `std::deque` is better).
  * **Use `reserve()` for Performance:** This is the most important optimization. If you know roughly how many elements you'll be adding, call `reserve()` once at the beginning. This avoids potentially many slow reallocations.
  * **Pass by `const&`:** Never pass a large vector by value unless you intend to copy it. Pass by `const` reference (`const std::vector<T>&`) for read-only access. Pass by non-const reference (`std::vector<T>&`) if you need to modify it.
  * **Prefer `emplace_back()`:** When adding objects to a vector, prefer `emplace_back()` over `push_back()`. It constructs the object in-place and can be significantly more efficient by avoiding temporary object creation and copies/moves.
  * **Beware Iterator Invalidation:** Always remember that any operation that changes the vector's `capacity` (like `push_back` on a full vector, `reserve`, etc.) invalidates *all* iterators, pointers, and references to its elements. Operations like `insert` and `erase` invalidate all iterators at and after the point of modification.
  * **Use the Erase-Remove Idiom:** To remove multiple elements based on a condition, this is the standard, efficient pattern.
  * **Be Careful with `vector<bool>`:** Its behavior is non-standard. If you need a true container of `bool`s (e.g., to pass to a function that takes a `bool*`), consider using `std::vector<char>` or `std::deque<bool>` instead.

-----

`std::vector` is the backbone of the STL sequence containers. Its performance characteristics and flexibility make it suitable for a vast range of problems.

Next, we will explore `std::deque`, a container that is similar to a vector but with the added ability to efficiently add and remove elements from its front.

Of course. Let's continue our journey with `std::deque`.

After mastering `std::vector`, which excels at back insertions and random access, `std::deque` is the perfect next step. It addresses one of `vector`'s main limitations: inefficient insertions at the front.

-----

### `std::deque` - The Double-Ended Queue

#### Introduction

`std::deque` (pronounced "deck," short for double-ended queue) is a sequence container that, like `std::vector`, provides dynamic size. Its key feature is that it allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at both its beginning and its end.

  * **Purpose:** To provide a dynamic array-like structure that is optimized for adding and removing elements from both the front and the back.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Not Contiguous Memory:** This is the most significant difference from `std::vector`. A `deque` does not store its elements in a single, contiguous block of memory. Instead, it is typically implemented as a sequence of smaller, individually allocated fixed-size arrays or "chunks." An internal data structure keeps track of these chunks in order.
      * **Efficient End Operations:** This memory model allows for highly efficient (amortized constant time) insertions and deletions at both ends. When a chunk at an end fills up, a new chunk is simply allocated; there is no need to copy all existing elements like in a `vector` reallocation.
      * **Slower Random Access:** While still providing $O(1)$ random access, it's slightly slower than a `vector`'s. To access an element `dq[i]`, the `deque` must first determine which chunk the element is in and then find its offset within that chunk, involving an extra level of indirection.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Random Access** (`[]`, `at()`): $O(1)$ - Constant time (but with a larger constant factor than `vector`).
      * **Adding/Removing at an End** (`push_front`, `pop_front`, `push_back`, `pop_back`): Amortized $O(1)$.
      * **Adding/Removing in the Middle** (`insert`, `erase`): $O(N)$ - Linear time, as it may involve shifting many elements. This is the worst-case scenario for a `deque`.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::vector`:** Use `std::vector` if you only need to add/remove from the back and require the absolute fastest random access and contiguous memory for C API interoperability. Use `std::deque` when you need efficient additions/removals at *both* ends. A `deque` may also be better for very large collections as it avoids allocating one massive contiguous block of memory.
      * **vs. `std::list`:** `std::deque` is a compromise between `vector` and `list`. `std::list` offers efficient $O(1)$ insertion/deletion *anywhere* in the middle (given an iterator), but has slow $O(N)$ random access. Use `std::deque` if you need both fast end operations and fast random access. Use `std::list` if you need frequent, fast middle insertions/deletions.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::deque`, you must include the `<deque>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::deque<T, Allocator> deque_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the deque will hold.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A deque of integers
    std::deque<int> int_deq;

    // A deque of strings
    std::deque<std::string> string_deq;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::deque objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

The constructors for `std::deque` are identical in syntax and function to those of `std::vector`, showcasing the consistent interface of STL containers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print deques
template<typename T>
void print_deque(const std::string& name, const std::deque<T>& deq) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << deq.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : deq) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    deque<int> d1;
    print_deque("1. Default", d1);

    // 2. Fill Constructor (with size)
    deque<int> d2(5); // 5 integers, value-initialized to 0
    print_deque("2. Fill (size)", d2);

    // 3. Fill Constructor (with size and value)
    deque<int> d3(5, 100); // 5 integers, all set to 100
    print_deque("3. Fill (size and value)", d3);

    // 4. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    deque<int> d4(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_deque("4. Range (from vector)", d4);

    // 5. Copy Constructor
    deque<int> d5(d4);
    print_deque("5. Copy", d5);

    // 6. Move Constructor (C++11)
    deque<int> d6(std::move(d5));
    print_deque("6. Move", d6);
    print_deque("   (d5 after move)", d5);

    // 7. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    deque<int> d7 = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8};
    print_deque("7. Initializer list", d7);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Assignment and Access

Access methods are also very similar to `vector`, with one notable exception: `std::deque` does **not** have a `.data()` member function because its memory is not contiguous.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Assignment and Access ---" << endl;

    deque<int> deq1 = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    deque<int> deq2;

    // --- Assignment ---
    // 1. Copy Assignment
    deq2 = deq1;
    cout << "1. deq2 after copy assignment: ";
    for(int v : deq2) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;

    // 2. Move Assignment
    deq2 = std::move(deq1);
    cout << "2. deq2 after move assignment: ";
    for(int v : deq2) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    cout << "   (deq1 size after move: " << deq1.size() << ")" << endl;

    // 3. assign() method
    deq2.assign(5, 99); // Fill version
    cout << "3. deq2 after assign(5, 99): ";
    for(int v : deq2) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // --- Access ---
    cout << "\n--- Accessing elements of deq2 ---" << endl;
    
    // 4. Subscript operator [] (no bounds check)
    cout << "4. Element at index 1 using []: " << deq2[1] << endl;

    // 5. at() member function (with bounds check)
    cout << "5. Element at index 2 using at(): " << deq2.at(2) << endl;
    try {
        deq2.at(10);
    } catch (const out_of_range& e) {
        cout << "   Caught exception when calling at(10): " << e.what() << endl;
    }

    // 6. front() and back()
    cout << "6. First element with front(): " << deq2.front() << endl;
    cout << "   Last element with back(): " << deq2.back() << endl;

    // 7. NO data() member function
    // The following line would cause a compile error:
    // int* p_data = deq2.data(); // ERROR: 'class std::deque<int>' has no member named 'data'

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### All Member Functions and Methods

The power of `deque` comes from its modifier functions, especially `push_front` and `pop_front`. Note the absence of `capacity()` and `reserve()`, which are `vector`-specific concepts tied to contiguous memory allocation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- All Member Functions ---" << endl;
    
    deque<string> d;

    // --- Modifiers ---
    // 1. push_back() and push_front()
    d.push_back("is");
    d.push_back("a");
    d.push_front("This");
    d.push_back("deque");
    // Deque is now: {"This", "is", "a", "deque"}

    cout << "Deque state: ";
    for(const auto& s : d) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;

    // 2. emplace_back() and emplace_front() (C++11)
    // Constructs elements in-place at the ends
    d.emplace_back("!");
    d.emplace_front("Hey,");
    // Deque is now: {"Hey,", "This", "is", "a", "deque", "!"}

    cout << "After emplace: ";
    for(const auto& s : d) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;

    // 3. pop_back() and pop_front()
    d.pop_front(); // Removes "Hey,"
    d.pop_back();  // Removes "!"
    
    cout << "After pops: ";
    for(const auto& s : d) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;

    // 4. insert()
    auto it = d.begin() + 2; // Iterator pointing to "a"
    d.insert(it, "really");
    
    cout << "After insert: ";
    for(const auto& s : d) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;

    // 5. erase()
    d.erase(d.begin()); // Removes "This"
    
    cout << "After erase: ";
    for(const auto& s : d) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;

    // --- Capacity ---
    cout << "\n--- Capacity Functions ---" << endl;
    cout << "d.size(): " << d.size() << endl;
    cout << "d.empty(): " << boolalpha << d.empty() << endl;

    // 6. resize()
    d.resize(5, "cool"); // Increases size, new elements are "cool"
    cout << "After resize(5, \"cool\"): ";
    for(const auto& s : d) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // 7. shrink_to_fit() (C++11)
    // Deallocates unused memory chunks.
    d.shrink_to_fit();

    // 8. clear()
    d.clear();
    cout << "After clear(), size is: " << d.size() << endl;
    
    // Note: No capacity() or reserve() for std::deque!

    return 0;
}
```

#### Iterators and Algorithms

Despite its complex internal structure, `std::deque` provides standard iterators that work seamlessly with all STL algorithms. A `deque` iterator is a special class object that knows how to navigate between memory chunks transparently.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm> // for std::sort, std::reverse
#include <numeric>   // for std::iota

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterators and Algorithms ---" << endl;

    deque<int> d(10);
    
    // 1. Fill with std::iota
    iota(d.begin(), d.end(), 1); // Fills deque with 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
    cout << "Initial deque: ";
    for(int v : d) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;

    // 2. Reverse the deque with std::reverse
    reverse(d.begin(), d.end());
    cout << "Reversed deque: ";
    for(int v : d) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // 3. Sort the deque with std::sort
    // Note: std::sort is efficient for deque because its iterators are random-access.
    sort(d.begin(), d.end());
    cout << "Sorted deque: ";
    for(int v : d) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // 4. Iterate with reverse iterators
    cout << "Reverse iteration: ";
    for(auto it = d.rbegin(); it != d.rend(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Examples and Edge Cases

##### Implementing a Sliding Window

A `deque` is the perfect data structure for implementing a sliding window algorithm, which processes a fixed-size sub-sequence of a larger data stream.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>

// Function to find the maximum in all subarrays of size k
void print_sliding_window_max(const std::vector<int>& data, int k) {
    if (data.size() < k || k <= 0) return;

    std::deque<int> window; // Will store indices of elements in the current window
    
    std::cout << "Max values in windows of size " << k << ": ";
    
    for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); ++i) {
        // Remove indices from the front that are out of the current window
        if (!window.empty() && window.front() <= i - k) {
            window.pop_front();
        }

        // Maintain decreasing order of values from front to back
        while (!window.empty() && data[window.back()] <= data[i]) {
            window.pop_back();
        }

        window.push_back(i);

        // The front of the deque is the index of the largest element in the previous window
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            std::cout << data[window.front()] << " ";
        }
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "--- Example: Sliding Window Maximum ---" << std::endl;
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7};
    int k = 3;
    print_sliding_window_max(data, k); // Expected output: 3 3 5 5 6 7
    return 0;
}
```

##### Iterator Invalidation

`std::deque` has more favorable iterator invalidation rules than `std::vector`.

  * **Insertions at ends (`push_front`/`back`):** Does not invalidate any iterators. Pointers and references to existing elements also remain valid. (This is a huge advantage over `vector` where a `push_back` can invalidate everything).
  * **Insertions in the middle:** Invalidates *all* iterators, but pointers and references to existing elements remain valid.
  * **Erasures at ends (`pop_front`/`back`):** Only invalidates iterators to the erased element.
  * **Erasures in the middle:** Invalidates *all* iterators.

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Choose `deque` for Queues:** If you are implementing a queue (FIFO) or any structure that requires frequent additions and removals from both ends, `std::deque` is the ideal choice. The standard library adapters `std::stack` and `std::queue` use `std::deque` as their default underlying container for this reason.
  * **Default to `vector`, Switch to `deque` When Needed:** `std::vector` is still the best default sequential container due to its simplicity, speed, and cache performance. Only switch to `std::deque` if you have a clear, performance-critical need for efficient front operations.
  * **Avoid Middle Insertions/Deletions:** If your algorithm requires many insertions or deletions in the middle of the sequence, a `std::deque` will perform poorly ($O(N)$). `std::list` is the appropriate container for that use case.
  * **Remember: No `data()`:** You cannot use a `std::deque` with C-style APIs that require a contiguous block of memory (e.g., `read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)`).
  * **Leverage Stable References:** The fact that insertions/deletions at the ends do not invalidate pointers/references to other elements can be a powerful feature, simplifying some complex algorithms where you need to store pointers to elements inside the container.

-----

We've now seen how `std::deque` fills a specific niche, offering a blend of `vector`-like random access and `list`-like flexibility at the ends.

Next, we will explore `std::list`, which fully embraces a non-contiguous, node-based storage model to provide maximum flexibility for insertions and deletions anywhere in the sequence.

Excellent, let's proceed.

We have explored `std::vector` (the fast-access, contiguous-memory workhorse) and `std::deque` (the flexible double-ended queue). Now, we will delve into `std::list`, a container designed for the single purpose of providing the fastest possible insertions and deletions, no matter where they occur in the sequence.

-----

### `std::list` - The Doubly-Linked List

#### Introduction

`std::list` is a sequence container that implements a doubly-linked list. Unlike `vector` and `deque`, it does not store its elements in a contiguous block of memory. Instead, each element is wrapped in its own node, which holds the element's data along with pointers to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence.

  * **Purpose:** To provide a container optimized for constant-time insertion and deletion of elements anywhere within the sequence.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Node-Based Storage:** Elements can be located anywhere in memory. This complete lack of contiguity is what enables its key features.
      * **Fast Insertions and Deletions:** Because elements are not stored in a single block, inserting or erasing an element is an extremely fast $O(1)$ operation, provided you have an iterator pointing to the location. It only requires updating the pointers of the adjacent nodes.
      * **No Random Access:** This is the major trade-off. There is no way to jump directly to the n-th element. Accessing an element by its position requires traversing the list from one of the ends, which is a slow $O(N)$ operation. `operator[]` and `.at()` are not provided.
      * **Excellent Iterator Stability:** Iterators, pointers, and references to an element in a `list` remain valid even when other elements are added or removed. An iterator is only invalidated if the specific element it points to is erased.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Access by Index:** $O(N)$ - Not directly supported, requires manual traversal.
      * **`front()` / `back()`:** $O(1)$.
      * **Insertion/Deletion (anywhere, with an iterator):** $O(1)$.
      * **Search:** $O(N)$.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::vector`/`std::deque`:** `std::list` is the opposite of a `vector`. Use `vector` for fast random access and good cache performance when middle insertions/deletions are rare. Use `list` when you must perform frequent middle insertions/deletions and do not need random access. Iterating over a `list` is significantly slower than iterating over a `vector` due to poor cache locality (pointer chasing).
      * **vs. `std::forward_list`:** `std::list` is a *doubly*-linked list, providing bidirectional iterators (`++it` and `--it`). `std::forward_list` is a *singly*-linked list, which is slightly more memory-efficient but can only be traversed forward.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::list`, you must include the `<list>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::list<T, Allocator> list_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the list will hold.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A list of integers
    std::list<int> int_list;

    // A list of strings
    std::list<std::string> string_list;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::list objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

The constructors for `std::list` follow the same standard pattern as other sequence containers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print lists
template<typename T>
void print_list(const std::string& name, const std::list<T>& l) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << l.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : l) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    list<int> l1;
    print_list("1. Default", l1);

    // 2. Fill Constructor (with size)
    list<int> l2(5); // 5 integers, value-initialized to 0
    print_list("2. Fill (size)", l2);

    // 3. Fill Constructor (with size and value)
    list<int> l3(5, 100);
    print_list("3. Fill (size and value)", l3);

    // 4. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {10, 20, 30};
    list<int> l4(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_list("4. Range (from vector)", l4);

    // 5. Copy Constructor
    list<int> l5(l4);
    print_list("5. Copy", l5);

    // 6. Move Constructor (C++11)
    list<int> l6(std::move(l5));
    print_list("6. Move", l6);
    print_list("   (l5 after move)", l5);

    // 7. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    list<int> l7 = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8};
    print_list("7. Initializer list", l7);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Assignment and Access

Access is limited to the ends of the list. **There is no `operator[]` or `.at()`**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Assignment and Access ---" << endl;

    list<string> list1 = {"A", "B", "C"};
    list<string> list2;

    // --- Assignment ---
    // 1. Copy Assignment
    list2 = list1;
    cout << "1. list2 after copy assignment: ";
    for(const auto& s : list2) cout << s << " "; cout << endl;

    // --- Access ---
    cout << "\n--- Accessing elements of list2 ---" << endl;
    
    if (!list2.empty()) {
        // 2. front() and back()
        cout << "2. First element with front(): " << list2.front() << endl;
        cout << "   Last element with back(): " << list2.back() << endl;
        
        // You can also modify the elements via these methods
        list2.front() = "Alpha";
        cout << "   After modification: " << list2.front() << endl;
    }
    
    // 3. NO random access
    // The following lines would cause compile errors:
    // string s = list2[1];      // ERROR
    // string s = list2.at(1);   // ERROR

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### All Member Functions and Methods

`std::list` has a rich set of member functions, including several that are unique to it and highly optimized for a node-based structure.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <string>
#include <numeric>

// Helper function from before
template<typename T>
void print_list(const std::string& name, const std::list<T>& l) {
    std::cout << name << ": { ";
    for (const auto& elem : l) { std::cout << elem << " "; }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- List-Specific Member Functions ---" << endl;

    // --- Splicing ---
    // splice() moves elements from one list to another without copying or reallocating.
    // It is an incredibly fast O(1) operation.
    list<int> list1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    list<int> list2 = {10, 20, 30};
    
    // Splice all of list2 into list1 at the beginning
    list1.splice(list1.begin(), list2);
    print_list("After splicing all of list2 into list1", list1);
    print_list("list2 is now empty", list2); // list2 is now empty

    // --- Removing Elements ---
    list<int> list3 = {1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5};
    // remove(): Removes all elements with a specific value.
    list3.remove(2); // Removes all 2s
    print_list("\nAfter remove(2)", list3);
    
    // remove_if(): Removes all elements satisfying a predicate.
    list3.remove_if([](int n){ return n > 3; }); // Removes 5, 4, 5
    print_list("After remove_if(n > 3)", list3);
    
    // --- Merging, Sorting, and Uniqueness ---
    list<int> l_a = {1, 9, 3, 7};
    list<int> l_b = {6, 2, 8, 4};
    
    // sort(): list provides its own sort because std::sort requires random-access iterators.
    l_a.sort();
    l_b.sort();
    print_list("\nSorted l_a", l_a);
    print_list("Sorted l_b", l_b);
    
    // merge(): Merges two SORTED lists. l_b becomes empty. O(N+M)
    l_a.merge(l_b);
    print_list("After merging l_b into l_a", l_a);
    print_list("l_b is now empty", l_b);
    
    // unique(): Removes consecutive duplicate elements.
    l_a.push_back(9); l_a.push_back(9);
    print_list("\nBefore unique()", l_a);
    l_a.unique();
    print_list("After unique()", l_a);
    
    // reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in O(N).
    l_a.reverse();
    print_list("After reverse()", l_a);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Iterators and Algorithms

The iterators for `std::list` are **Bidirectional Iterators**. This means they support `++` and `--` but not arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, or relational comparisons like `<` and `>`.

This has a critical consequence: any STL algorithm from `<algorithm>` that requires random access (like `std::sort`, `std::nth_element`) **will not compile** with `std::list` iterators.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <algorithm> // for std::find
#include <numeric>   // for std::accumulate

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterators and Algorithms ---" << endl;
    
    list<int> my_list = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    
    // 1. Supported Operations: ++ and --
    auto it = my_list.begin();
    ++it; // OK, it now points to 20
    ++it; // OK, it now points to 30
    --it; // OK, it now points back to 20
    cout << "Iterator is pointing to: " << *it << endl;

    // 2. Unsupported Operations
    // The following lines would cause compile errors:
    // it = it + 2;                  // ERROR
    // auto it2 = my_list.begin();
    // if (it2 < it) { ... }         // ERROR
    
    // 3. Algorithms that work
    // std::find only needs InputIterators, so it works fine.
    auto find_it = std::find(my_list.begin(), my_list.end(), 30);
    if (find_it != my_list.end()) {
        cout << "Found value 30." << endl;
    }
    
    // std::accumulate also works.
    int sum = std::accumulate(my_list.begin(), my_list.end(), 0);
    cout << "Sum of elements: " << sum << endl;
    
    // 4. Algorithms that DO NOT work
    // std::sort(my_list.begin(), my_list.end()); // COMPILE ERROR
    // Instead, you must use the member function:
    my_list.sort();
    cout << "List is sorted (using member function)." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Examples and Edge Cases

##### Iterator Stability

The most powerful feature of `std::list` is that iterators are not invalidated by insertions or deletions of other elements.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterator Stability Example ---" << endl;
    
    list<int> l(3);
    iota(l.begin(), l.end(), 1); // Fills list with {1, 2, 3}
    
    cout << "Initial list: ";
    for(int v : l) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // Get iterators to all the elements
    auto it1 = l.begin();                           // -> 1
    auto it2 = next(it1);                           // -> 2
    auto it3 = next(it2);                           // -> 3
    
    cout << "it1 -> " << *it1 << ", it2 -> " << *it2 << ", it3 -> " << *it3 << endl;

    // Insert an element before it2
    l.insert(it2, 99); // List is now {1, 99, 2, 3}
    
    cout << "\nAfter inserting 99 before it2..." << endl;
    cout << "List is now: ";
    for(int v : l) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // The iterators are STILL VALID and point to their original elements!
    // This would not be true for std::vector or std::deque.
    cout << "it1 -> " << *it1 << ", it2 -> " << *it2 << ", it3 -> " << *it3 << endl;

    // Now erase the element pointed to by it2
    l.erase(it2); // List is now {1, 99, 3}
    
    cout << "\nAfter erasing element at it2..." << endl;
    cout << "List is now: ";
    for(int v : l) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // it1 and it3 are still valid.
    cout << "it1 -> " << *it1 << ", it3 -> " << *it3 << endl;
    // it2 is now invalidated and cannot be dereferenced.
    // cout << "it2 -> " << *it2 << endl; // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use `std::list` for its Specific Strengths:** Only choose `std::list` when you have a clear need for frequent, fast insertions and deletions in the middle of a sequence *and* you do not require random access.
  * **Beware of Performance Costs:** Be mindful of the two main performance drawbacks of `std::list`:
    1.  **Memory Overhead:** Each element requires extra memory for two pointers (next and previous).
    2.  **Cache Inefficiency:** Iterating over a `list` is much slower than a `vector` because the CPU cache cannot effectively prefetch the next element, as it could be anywhere in memory.
  * **Prefer Member Functions:** For operations like sorting, removing elements, merging, and reversing, always use the specialized member functions (`my_list.sort()`, `my_list.remove()`) instead of the generic algorithms from `<algorithm>`. They are vastly more efficient as they work by rearranging pointers rather than copying data.
  * **A Specialized Tool:** In modern C++, `std::list` is considered a more specialized container. The cache performance of `std::vector` is so good that for small-to-medium sized collections, even an $O(N)$ insertion (shifting elements) in a `vector` can sometimes be faster than an $O(1)$ insertion (allocating a node and rearranging pointers) in a `list`. Profile your code if performance is critical.

-----

`std::list` is a master of pointer manipulation, offering unparalleled flexibility for modifying sequences. Its trade-offs are significant, but in the right scenario, its performance characteristics are unbeatable.

Next, we'll look at its close relative, `std::forward_list`, a singly-linked list that trims down `std::list` for even greater efficiency in forward-only traversal scenarios.

Excellent. Having explored the doubly-linked `std::list`, we'll now examine its lean, C++11-introduced sibling: `std::forward_list`. This container is designed with one philosophy in mind: absolute minimalism for maximum efficiency.

-----

### `std::forward_list` - The Singly-Linked List

#### Introduction

`std::forward_list`, introduced in C++11, is a sequence container that implements a singly-linked list. It is the most lightweight of all the STL's sequential containers. Each element is stored in a node that contains the data and a single pointer to the next element in the sequence. This minimalist design leads to some unique properties and trade-offs.

  * **Purpose:** To provide the most memory-efficient linked-list structure for algorithms that only require forward traversal and insertion.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Singly-Linked:** Nodes only point to their successor. This means you can only iterate forwards, one element at a time.
      * **Memory Efficiency:** By omitting the "previous" pointer found in `std::list`, a `std::forward_list` has the lowest memory overhead per element of any dynamic STL container.
      * **Optimized for Front Operations:** All operations are designed around the head of the list. `push_front` is efficient, but there is no `push_back`.
      * **No `size()` Method:** In a radical design choice for performance, `std::forward_list` does not keep track of its size. Calling a `.size()` method would require traversing the entire list, an $O(N)$ operation. To ensure all its operations are maximally efficient, this function is omitted entirely. If you need the size, you must compute it manually.
      * **"After" Operations:** Since you can't go backward from an iterator to get the previous node, all insertion and deletion operations are named with an `_after` suffix (e.g., `insert_after`). They modify the list *after* the position given by an iterator.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Access `front()`:** $O(1)$.
      * **Insertion/Deletion (with an iterator to the preceding element):** $O(1)$.
      * **Search:** $O(N)$.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::list`:** `std::forward_list` is the clear choice if you are extremely constrained by memory and only need forward iteration. `std::list` is more general-purpose, offering bidirectional traversal and efficient `push_back`/`pop_back` at the cost of one extra pointer per element and a `size` member.
      * **vs. `std::vector`:** The trade-offs are even more stark. `vector` provides fast random access and is cache-friendly. `forward_list` provides fast front-insertions and has minimal memory overhead. They are designed for completely different problem domains.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::forward_list`, you must include the `<forward_list>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::forward_list<T, Allocator> list_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the list will hold.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A forward_list of integers
    std::forward_list<int> flist_int;

    // A forward_list of strings
    std::forward_list<std::string> flist_string;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::forward_list objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

The constructors are standard and consistent with other sequence containers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print forward_lists
template<typename T>
void print_flist(const std::string& name, const std::forward_list<T>& fl) {
    std::cout << name << ": { ";
    for (const auto& elem : fl) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    forward_list<int> fl1;
    print_flist("1. Default", fl1);

    // 2. Fill Constructor (with size and value)
    forward_list<int> fl2(5, 100);
    print_flist("2. Fill", fl2);

    // 3. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {10, 20, 30};
    forward_list<int> fl3(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_flist("3. Range (from vector)", fl3);

    // 4. Copy Constructor
    forward_list<int> fl4(fl3);
    print_flist("4. Copy", fl4);

    // 5. Move Constructor (C++11)
    forward_list<int> fl5(std::move(fl4));
    print_flist("5. Move", fl5);
    print_flist("   (fl4 after move)", fl4);

    // 6. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    forward_list<int> fl6 = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8};
    print_flist("6. Initializer list", fl6);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Assignment and Access

Access is strictly limited to the very first element. There is no `back()`, `operator[]`, or `at()`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Assignment and Access ---" << endl;

    forward_list<string> flist = {"A", "B", "C"};

    // --- Access ---
    if (!flist.empty()) {
        // 1. front()
        cout << "1. First element with front(): " << flist.front() << endl;
        
        // You can modify the front element
        flist.front() = "Alpha";
        cout << "   After modification: " << flist.front() << endl;
    }
    
    // 2. NO other access methods
    // The following would all cause compile errors:
    // auto val = flist.back();
    // auto val = flist[1];
    // auto val = flist.at(1);
    
    // 3. NO size() method
    // The following would cause a compile error:
    // cout << "Size is: " << flist.size() << endl;
    
    // To get the size, you must calculate it manually (O(N) operation)
    auto size = std::distance(flist.begin(), flist.end());
    cout << "3. Manual size calculation: " << size << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### All Member Functions and Methods

The method names in `forward_list` reflect its unique structure, featuring `_after` suffixes and the special `before_begin` iterator.

##### The `before_begin` Iterator

To insert or delete at a position, a linked list needs a pointer to the *previous* node. For the very first element, there is no previous node. `before_begin()` returns a special iterator that serves as a handle to this "one-before-the-start" position, allowing insertions and deletions at the head of the list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>

// Helper function from before
template<typename T>
void print_flist(const std::string& name, const std::forward_list<T>& fl) {
    std::cout << name << ": { ";
    for (const auto& elem : fl) { std::cout << elem << " "; }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Member Functions with _after ---" << endl;
    
    forward_list<int> fl = {10, 20, 30};
    
    // --- Inserting ---
    // 1. insert_after(): inserts elements AFTER a given position.
    
    // To insert at the very beginning, use before_begin()
    auto it_before_begin = fl.before_begin();
    fl.insert_after(it_before_begin, 5); // Insert 5 after the "before beginning" position
    print_flist("Insert 5 at front", fl); // {5, 10, 20, 30}
    
    // To insert after the first element (which is now 5)
    auto it_first = fl.begin();
    fl.insert_after(it_first, 15); // Insert 15 after 5
    print_flist("Insert 15 after 5", fl); // {5, 15, 10, 20, 30}
    
    // 2. emplace_after(): constructs element in-place AFTER a position.
    fl.emplace_after(it_first, 18); // Emplace 18 after 5
    print_flist("Emplace 18 after 5", fl); // {5, 18, 15, 10, 20, 30}

    // --- Erasing ---
    // 3. erase_after(): erases the element AFTER a given position.
    
    // Erase the element after the first one (erase 18)
    fl.erase_after(fl.begin());
    print_flist("Erase after first elem", fl); // {5, 15, 10, 20, 30}
    
    // To erase the first element, use before_begin()
    fl.erase_after(fl.before_begin());
    print_flist("Erase first elem", fl); // {15, 10, 20, 30}
    
    // --- Splicing ---
    // 4. splice_after(): moves elements from another list AFTER a position. O(1)
    forward_list<int> fl2 = {100, 200};
    fl.splice_after(fl.begin(), fl2);
    print_flist("Splice fl2 after 1st elem", fl); // {15, 100, 200, 10, 20, 30}
    print_flist("fl2 is now empty", fl2);
    
    // --- Other Modifiers ---
    fl.push_front(1);
    fl.pop_front();
    fl.remove(20); // remove(), sort(), etc. exist as member functions
    print_flist("\nAfter other modifiers", fl);
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Iterators and Algorithms

The iterators for `std::forward_list` are **Forward Iterators**. They only support `++it` (prefix and postfix) and dereferencing (`*it`). You cannot move them backward (`--it`). This restricts them to algorithms that make a single pass from beginning to end.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterators and Algorithms ---" << endl;
    
    forward_list<int> fl = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    
    // 1. Supported Operation: ++
    auto it = fl.begin();
    ++it; // OK, points to 20
    ++it; // OK, points to 30
    
    // 2. Unsupported Operation: --
    // --it; // COMPILE ERROR
    
    // 3. Algorithms that work (single forward pass)
    auto find_it = std::find(fl.begin(), fl.end(), 40);
    if (find_it != fl.end()) {
        cout << "Found value 40." << endl;
    }
    
    int sum = std::accumulate(fl.begin(), fl.end(), 0);
    cout << "Sum of elements: " << sum << endl;
    
    // 4. Algorithms that DO NOT work
    // std::reverse(fl.begin(), fl.end()); // COMPILE ERROR, requires bidirectional iterators
    // Instead, use the member function:
    fl.reverse();
    cout << "Reversed list (using member): ";
    for(int v : fl) cout << v << " "; cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use Case is Niche:** `std::forward_list` is a highly specialized container. You should only choose it when you have a performance-critical situation where memory overhead must be minimized *and* your algorithm only ever needs to iterate forward and insert/remove from the front (or after a known element). A common example is a memory pool "free list."
  * **No `size()` is a Feature, Not a Bug:** The omission of `size()` is a deliberate design choice to guarantee that no hidden $O(N)$ costs are incurred. If your algorithm depends on knowing the size frequently, `forward_list` is the wrong container for the job.
  * **Think `_after`:** All modifications require thinking about the element *preceding* the point of change. This programming model, especially the use of `before_begin()`, takes some getting used to.
  * **Prefer `std::vector` or `std::list` in General:** For almost all everyday programming tasks, the performance benefits and richer interface of `std::vector` (for general use) or `std::list` (for bidirectional modification) make them far better choices. The cache-friendliness of `vector` often makes it faster in practice even when theory might suggest a linked list.

-----

We have now covered the primary linear sequence containers provided by the STL. Each one—`array`, `vector`, `deque`, `list`, and `forward_list`—offers a unique set of trade-offs between memory layout, access speed, and modification flexibility.

Our journey now takes a significant turn. We will move from *sequential containers*, which order elements by their position, to **associative containers**, which organize elements by their *value* or *key*. We will begin with the fundamental ordered associative container: `std::set`.

Of course. Having thoroughly covered the STL's sequential containers, we now pivot to a new category: **associative containers**. These containers are fundamentally different. Instead of storing elements by their position or index, they organize elements based on their *key*, enabling fast lookups.

We begin with the most fundamental ordered associative container, `std::set`.

-----

### `std::set` - The Ordered Set of Unique Keys

#### Introduction

`std::set` is an associative container that stores a sorted collection of unique elements. The value of an element is also its key. Once a value is inserted, it is automatically sorted into place.

  * **Purpose:** To store unique elements in a sorted order, allowing for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of elements by their value.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Sorted:** Elements in a `std::set` are always kept in a strict weak ordering. By default, this is ascending order (`std::less`, which uses `operator<`), but you can provide a custom comparison function.
      * **Unique Keys:** A `std::set` cannot contain duplicate elements. If you try to insert an element that already exists, the operation is simply ignored.
      * **Associative:** Elements are accessed by their value (key), not by a numerical index.
      * **Immutable Keys:** Once an element is inserted into a `std::set`, its value cannot be modified in-place. This is because changing the value would violate the set's sorted structure. To "update" an element, you must erase the old one and insert the new one.
  * **Underlying Implementation:** The C++ standard does not mandate a specific implementation, but `std::set` is almost universally implemented as a **balanced binary search tree** (typically a Red-Black Tree). This structure is what guarantees its performance characteristics.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Search (`find`), Insertion (`insert`), and Deletion (`erase`):** $O(\\log N)$ - Logarithmic time complexity for both average and worst cases.
      * **Range Queries (`lower_bound`, `upper_bound`):** $O(\\log N)$.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::multiset`:** `std::multiset` is nearly identical to `std::set` but with one key difference: it allows duplicate elements.
      * **vs. `std::unordered_set`:** `std::unordered_set` is a hash-table-based container. It offers faster average-case performance ($O(1)$) for lookups, insertions, and deletions but has a worst-case of $O(N)$. Crucially, it does **not** store elements in any particular order. Use `std::set` when you need sorted data or guaranteed logarithmic performance. Use `std::unordered_set` for maximum average-case speed when order is irrelevant.
      * **vs. Sorted `std::vector`:** A sorted `vector` allows for $O(\\log N)$ lookups (`std::binary_search`), but insertions and deletions are slow ($O(N)$). `std::set` is far superior when the collection is modified frequently.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::set`, you must include the `<set>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::set<Key, Compare, Allocator> set_name;`

  * `Key`: The type of elements the set will hold.
  * `Compare`: An optional comparison function object. Defaults to `std::less<Key>`, which uses `operator<` for sorting in ascending order.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <functional> // For std::greater

int main() {
    // A set of integers, sorted in default ascending order
    std::set<int> ascending_set;

    // A set of strings
    std::set<std::string> string_set;
    
    // A set of integers sorted in descending order
    // We provide std::greater<int> as the comparison function
    std::set<int, std::greater<int>> descending_set;

    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::set objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

`std::set` provides the standard range of constructors.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

// Helper function to print sets
template<typename T, typename C>
void print_set(const std::string& name, const std::set<T, C>& s) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << s.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : s) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    set<int> s1;
    s1.insert(10);
    s1.insert(5);
    print_set("1. Default", s1);

    // 2. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {50, 20, 80, 20, 50}; // Duplicates will be ignored
    set<int> s2(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_set("2. Range (from vector)", s2);

    // 3. Copy Constructor
    set<int> s3(s2);
    print_set("3. Copy", s3);

    // 4. Move Constructor (C++11)
    set<int> s4(std::move(s3));
    print_set("4. Move", s4);
    print_set("   (s3 after move)", s3);

    // 5. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    set<int> s5 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 6, 8}; // Duplicates are ignored
    print_set("5. Initializer list", s5);
    
    // 6. Constructor with custom comparator
    set<int, greater<int>> s6 = {10, 30, 20};
    print_set("6. Custom comparator", s6);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Member Functions and Methods

The power of `std::set` lies in its efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion methods.

##### Modifiers

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Modifier Functions ---" << endl;
    set<string> s;

    // 1. insert(): Inserts an element. Returns a pair.
    // The pair contains an iterator to the element and a bool which is true if insertion took place.
    auto result1 = s.insert("apple");
    cout << "Inserting \"apple\": success = " << boolalpha << result1.second 
         << ", value = " << *result1.first << endl;
         
    auto result2 = s.insert("banana");
    
    auto result3 = s.insert("apple"); // Try to insert a duplicate
    cout << "Inserting \"apple\" again: success = " << result3.second 
         << ", value = " << *result3.first << endl;

    // 2. emplace() (C++11): Constructs element in-place. More efficient.
    s.emplace("pear");

    cout << "Set contents: ";
    for(const auto& val : s) cout << val << " "; cout << endl;
    
    // 3. erase(): Removes elements.
    // By key value: returns number of elements erased (0 or 1 for set)
    size_t erased_count = s.erase("apple");
    cout << "\nErasing \"apple\": " << erased_count << " element(s) erased." << endl;
    
    // By iterator: returns iterator to the element after the one erased. O(1) amortized.
    auto it = s.find("pear");
    if (it != s.end()) {
        s.erase(it);
    }
    
    cout << "Set contents after erase: ";
    for(const auto& val : s) cout << val << " "; cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

##### Lookup Operations

These logarithmic-time functions are the primary reason to use a `std::set`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Lookup Operations ---" << endl;
    set<int> s = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70};

    // 1. find(): Returns an iterator to an element, or s.end() if not found.
    auto it = s.find(30);
    if (it != s.end()) {
        cout << "Found 30 in the set." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "30 not found." << endl;
    }
    
    // 2. count(): Returns 1 if the element exists, 0 otherwise.
    cout << "Does the set have 40? " << (s.count(40) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    cout << "Does the set have 99? " << (s.count(99) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    // 3. contains() (C++20): The modern, cleaner way to check for existence.
    #if __cplusplus >= 202002L
        cout << "C++20 contains(50): " << boolalpha << s.contains(50) << endl;
        cout << "C++20 contains(99): " << boolalpha << s.contains(99) << endl;
    #endif

    // 4. lower_bound(): Returns an iterator to the first element that is NOT LESS THAN the key.
    // In other words, the first element >= key.
    auto it_lower = s.lower_bound(35);
    cout << "lower_bound for 35 is: " << *it_lower << endl; // -> 40

    // 5. upper_bound(): Returns an iterator to the first element that is GREATER THAN the key.
    auto it_upper = s.upper_bound(50);
    cout << "upper_bound for 50 is: " << *it_upper << endl; // -> 60
    
    // 6. equal_range(): Returns a pair of iterators [lower_bound, upper_bound).
    auto range = s.equal_range(40);
    cout << "equal_range for 40 is: [" << *range.first << ", " << *range.second << ")" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Iterators and Algorithms

Iterators for `std::set` are bidirectional. A crucial property is that they are **constant iterators**. You can read the value they point to, but you cannot change it. This enforces the immutability of keys within the set.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterators and Algorithms ---" << endl;
    
    set<int> s = {33, 11, 55, 22, 44};
    
    // Iteration automatically yields elements in sorted order
    cout << "Iterating forwards (sorted): ";
    for (const auto& val : s) {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    // You cannot modify elements via an iterator
    auto it = s.find(22);
    // *it = 25; // COMPILE ERROR! Cannot assign to a const value.

    // Using lower_bound and upper_bound to process a range
    cout << "Values in the set between 20 and 50 are: ";
    auto start = s.lower_bound(20);
    auto end = s.upper_bound(50);
    
    for (auto current = start; current != end; ++current) {
        cout << *current << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Examples and Edge Cases

##### Using a Custom Type and Comparator

To store custom objects in a `std::set`, you must tell the set how to compare them. You can do this by overloading `operator<` for your type, or by providing a custom comparator functor.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>

struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;

    // Option 1: Overload operator< for the class
    // This defines the default sorting for Person objects
    bool operator<(const Person& other) const {
        // Sort primarily by age, then by name for ties
        if (age < other.age) return true;
        if (age > other.age) return false;
        return name < other.name;
    }
};

// Option 2: A separate comparator struct (functor)
struct PersonNameComparator {
    bool operator()(const Person& a, const Person& b) const {
        return a.name < b.name; // Sort by name only
    }
};

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Custom Types and Comparators ---" << endl;
    
    // Using the overloaded operator< (default behavior)
    set<Person> people_by_age = {{"Charlie", 30}, {"Alice", 25}, {"Bob", 30}};
    cout << "People sorted by age (then name):" << endl;
    for (const auto& p : people_by_age) {
        cout << "  - " << p.name << " (" << p.age << ")" << endl;
    }
    
    // Using the custom comparator functor
    set<Person, PersonNameComparator> people_by_name = {{"Charlie", 30}, {"Alice", 25}, {"Bob", 30}};
    cout << "\nPeople sorted by name:" << endl;
    for (const auto& p : people_by_name) {
        cout << "  - " << p.name << " (" << p.age << ")" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **`set` vs. `unordered_set`:** This is the primary decision. If you need your elements to be sorted, or if you need to perform range queries (e.g., find all items between X and Y), or if you cannot tolerate potential worst-case $O(N)$ performance, use `std::set`. Otherwise, `std::unordered_set` is generally faster.
  * **Keys are Immutable:** Never forget this. To change an element, you must `erase()` the old value and `insert()` the new one. C++23 introduces `std::set::extract` for a more efficient way to do this, but the erase-insert pattern is the standard approach.
  * **Define a Strict Weak Ordering:** When creating a custom comparator, ensure it defines a "strict weak ordering." The simplest rule of thumb is to implement the logic for a less-than (`<`) comparison. Never use `<=` in your comparator, as this will break the set's internal logic.
  * **Prefer `contains()` (C++20):** For checking if an element exists, `s.contains(key)` is more readable and directly expresses your intent compared to `s.count(key)` or `s.find(key) != s.end()`.
  * **Use `lower_bound` for "Find or Insert":** A common pattern is to find an element, and if it's not there, insert it. `lower_bound` can help. You can check if the element at the returned iterator is the one you were looking for.

-----

`std::set` is your go-to container for maintaining a collection of unique, sorted items. Its logarithmic performance guarantees make it reliable and efficient for a wide variety of tasks.

Next, we will look at its close sibling, `std::multiset`, which relaxes the "uniqueness" constraint and opens up new possibilities.

Right away.

After `std::set`, which enforces strict uniqueness, the natural next step is its more permissive counterpart: `std::multiset`. It's built on the same principles but relaxes one fundamental rule, which makes it suitable for a different set of problems.

-----

### `std::multiset` - The Ordered Collection of Keys

#### Introduction

`std::multiset` is an associative container that is nearly identical to `std::set`, with one critical difference: it **allows duplicate elements**. It stores a sorted collection of elements (where the value is the key), and multiple elements can have the same value.

  * **Purpose:** To store a collection of elements in a sorted order while allowing multiple elements to have the same value. It's ideal for situations where you need to count occurrences or maintain a sorted log of events that may not be unique.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Sorted:** Just like `std::set`, elements are always kept in a specific sorted order, governed by a comparison function.
      * **Duplicate Keys Allowed:** This is the defining feature. You can insert the value `10` five times, and the `multiset` will contain five distinct copies of `10`.
      * **Associative:** Elements are organized and accessed by their value.
      * **Immutable Keys:** Elements cannot be modified in-place.
  * **Underlying Implementation:** Like `std::set`, this is almost always a balanced binary search tree (e.g., a Red-Black Tree).
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Insertion (`insert`):** $O(\\log N)$.
      * **Deletion (`erase`):** Erasing by iterator is $O(\\log N)$ (amortized). Erasing by key is $O(\\log N + K)$, where K is the number of elements erased.
      * **Search (`find`, `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`):** $O(\\log N)$.
      * **Counting (`count`):** $O(\\log N + K)$, where K is the number of matching elements.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::set`:** The only difference is the handling of duplicates. If you need to enforce uniqueness, use `std::set`. If you need to store all values, use `std::multiset`.
      * **vs. `std::map<Key, size_t>`:** If your goal is just to count frequencies, a `map` can be more memory-efficient. For example, to store one thousand 10s, a `map` would store the key `10` once and a count of `1000`. A `multiset` would store one thousand separate nodes, each containing the integer `10`. However, `multiset` is simpler if you need to represent every individual instance.
      * **vs. `std::unordered_multiset`:** The same trade-off as `set` vs. `unordered_set`. `multiset` is sorted with guaranteed logarithmic performance. `unordered_multiset` is unsorted with faster average-case ($O(1)$) performance.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

`std::multiset` is also defined in the `<set>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::multiset<Key, Compare, Allocator> multiset_name;`

  * `Key`: The type of elements.
  * `Compare`: The optional comparison function object. Defaults to `std::less<Key>`.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set> // multiset is in the <set> header
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A multiset of integers, which can hold duplicates
    std::multiset<int> int_mset;

    // A multiset of strings
    std::multiset<std::string> string_mset;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::multiset objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

The constructors are identical to `std::set`, but they will now preserve any duplicates from the source.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print multisets
template<typename T, typename C>
void print_mset(const std::string& name, const std::multiset<T, C>& ms) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << ms.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : ms) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    multiset<int> ms1;
    ms1.insert(10);
    ms1.insert(5);
    ms1.insert(10); // Duplicate is kept
    print_mset("1. Default", ms1);

    // 2. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {50, 20, 80, 20, 50}; // Duplicates will be kept
    multiset<int> ms2(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_mset("2. Range (from vector)", ms2);

    // 3. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    multiset<int> ms3 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 6, 8}; // Duplicates are kept
    print_mset("3. Initializer list", ms3);
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Member Functions and Methods

Most functions behave like `std::set`'s, but their return values and effects are adapted for handling duplicates.

##### Modifiers and the `erase` Distinction

The behavior of `erase` is the most important distinction to learn.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Modifiers (Especially erase) ---" << endl;
    
    multiset<int> ms = {10, 20, 20, 20, 30, 40};
    
    cout << "Initial multiset: { ";
    for(int v : ms) cout << v << " "; cout << "}" << endl;
    
    // insert() always inserts. The returned iterator points to the newly added element.
    auto it_ins = ms.insert(25);
    cout << "Inserted element " << *it_ins << endl;

    // erase(key): Erases ALL elements with the given key.
    // Returns the number of elements erased.
    size_t num_erased = ms.erase(20);
    cout << "\nCalled erase(20). Number of elements erased: " << num_erased << endl;
    
    cout << "Multiset after erasing all 20s: { ";
    for(int v : ms) cout << v << " "; cout << "}" << endl;

    ms.insert(50);
    ms.insert(50);
    ms.insert(50);
    
    cout << "\nMultiset state: { ";
    for(int v : ms) cout << v << " "; cout << "}" << endl;

    // erase(iterator): Erases only the ONE element at the iterator's position.
    // To erase just one 50, we first find one.
    auto it_find = ms.find(50);
    if (it_find != ms.end()) {
        ms.erase(it_find); // Erase only this specific instance
    }

    cout << "Multiset after erasing one 50: { ";
    for(int v : ms) cout << v << " "; cout << "}" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

##### Lookup Operations and `equal_range`

The lookup functions are where a `multiset` truly differentiates itself, providing powerful ways to inspect groups of duplicate elements.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Lookup Operations ---" << endl;
    multiset<int> ms = {10, 20, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50};

    // 1. count(): Returns the number of occurrences of a key.
    cout << "Count of 30: " << ms.count(30) << endl; // -> 3
    cout << "Count of 99: " << ms.count(99) << endl; // -> 0

    // 2. find(): Returns an iterator to the FIRST occurrence of the key.
    auto it = ms.find(30);
    if (it != ms.end()) {
        cout << "find(30) points to the first 30." << endl;
    }

    // 3. lower_bound() and upper_bound() define the range of all occurrences.
    auto it_lower = ms.lower_bound(30); // -> Iterator to the first 30
    auto it_upper = ms.upper_bound(30); // -> Iterator to 40 (the element after the last 30)
    
    cout << "lower_bound(30) is " << *it_lower << endl;
    cout << "upper_bound(30) is " << *it_upper << endl;
    
    // 4. equal_range(): The best way to get the range of all duplicate keys.
    // It returns a pair of iterators [lower_bound, upper_bound).
    cout << "\nUsing equal_range to iterate over all 30s:" << endl;
    auto range = ms.equal_range(30);
    for (auto current = range.first; current != range.second; ++current) {
        cout << "  Found a " << *current << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Iterators and Algorithms

Iterators remain constant and bidirectional. The most important idiomatic use of iterators with `std::multiset` is to process all duplicate entries using the range provided by `equal_range`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Iterating over Duplicates ---" << endl;
    
    multiset<string> fruit_basket = {"apple", "orange", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple"};
    
    // Print all fruits
    cout << "Fruit basket contents: ";
    for (const auto& fruit : fruit_basket) {
        cout << fruit << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Let's process all the "apple" entries
    cout << "\nProcessing all apples:" << endl;
    auto range = fruit_basket.equal_range("apple");
    
    // Calculate the distance to see how many there are
    cout << "  There are " << distance(range.first, range.second) << " apples." << endl;
    
    // Iterate just through that range
    for (auto it = range.first; it != range.second; ++it) {
        cout << "  - Processing an " << *it << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **When to use `std::multiset`:** Choose `multiset` when you need to store all instances of some data, require that data to be sorted, and need to efficiently query for groups of identical items. Common use cases include storing log entries with timestamps (which might not be unique) or a leaderboard of scores (where multiple players can have the same score).
  * **`erase(key)` vs `erase(iterator)`:** This is the most common pitfall. Always remember that `ms.erase(key)` removes *all* matching items. If you only want to remove one, you must get an iterator to it first (e.g., via `find()`) and then pass that iterator to `erase()`.
  * **Prefer `equal_range`:** When you need to find and work with all elements of a certain value, `equal_range` is the most direct and efficient method. It performs two logarithmic searches (`lower_bound` and `upper_bound`) to give you a precise range to iterate over.
  * **Consider `map` for Frequency Counts:** If your primary goal is simply to count how many times each item appears, `std::map<Key, int>` is often a better choice. It's more memory-efficient if the counts are high and can be more intuitive to work with (`my_map[key]++`).

-----

`std::multiset` completes the `set` family by providing a sorted, associative container that embraces duplicates. Its ability to efficiently manage groups of identical, sorted items makes it a valuable tool.

With sets covered, we now move to their powerful cousins: maps. We'll start with `std::map`, which, like `std::set`, is ordered, but it introduces a new concept: separating the key used for sorting from an associated mapped value.

Of course. We have arrived at one of the most important and frequently used containers in the entire STL: `std::map`. This container takes the sorted, associative principles of `std::set` and extends them to manage key-value pairs, forming the basis for dictionaries and look-up tables in C++.

-----

### `std::map` - The Ordered Key-Value Dictionary

#### Introduction

`std::map` is an associative container that stores elements in a sorted order as key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. It is the quintessential dictionary data structure in C++. You use a key to look up its associated value.

  * **Purpose:** To provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data associated with a unique key, while keeping the keys sorted.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Key-Value Pairs:** Each element in a map is a `std::pair`. The first component of the pair is the `const Key`, and the second component is the `T` (the mapped value).
      * **Sorted by Key:** The elements are always sorted based on their keys according to a comparison function (by default, `std::less<Key>`).
      * **Unique Keys:** No two elements in a map can have the same key.
      * **Direct Value Modification:** While you cannot change the key of an element once it's in the map, you can freely modify its associated mapped value.
  * **Underlying Implementation:** Typically a balanced binary search tree (like a Red-Black Tree), which stores nodes containing the `std::pair` elements.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Access (`[]`, `at`), Search (`find`), Insertion (`insert`), and Deletion (`erase`):** $O(\\log N)$ in all cases.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::set`:** A `std::set<T>` is conceptually similar to a `std::map<T, some_dummy_type>`. Use a `set` when you only care about the existence of unique keys. Use a `map` when you need to associate each unique key with another piece of data (a value).
      * **vs. `std::multimap`:** `std::multimap` is nearly identical to `std::map` but allows duplicate keys.
      * **vs. `std::unordered_map`:** The most common alternative. `unordered_map` uses a hash table, providing faster average-case performance ($O(1)$) but without keeping keys in any sorted order. Use `std::map` when you need sorted keys, need to perform range queries, or require guaranteed logarithmic performance. Otherwise, `std::unordered_map` is often preferred for its speed.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::map`, you must include the `<map>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::map<Key, T, Compare, Allocator> map_name;`

  * `Key`: The type of the keys.
  * `T`: The type of the mapped values.
  * `Compare`: An optional comparison function object for the keys. Defaults to `std::less<Key>`.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A map from strings (keys) to integers (values)
    std::map<std::string, int> word_counts;

    // A map from integers (keys) to doubles (values)
    std::map<int, double> sensor_readings;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::map objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

Maps are initialized with collections of key-value pairs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print maps
template<typename K, typename V, typename C>
void print_map(const std::string& name, const std::map<K, V, C>& m) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << m.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& pair : m) {
        std::cout << "{" << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << "} ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    map<string, int> m1;
    m1["one"] = 1;
    m1["two"] = 2;
    print_map("1. Default", m1);

    // 2. Range Constructor
    vector<pair<string, int>> source_vec = {{"banana", 2}, {"apple", 1}, {"cherry", 3}};
    map<string, int> m2(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_map("2. Range (from vector of pairs)", m2);

    // 3. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    // The most convenient way. Note the nested braces for pairs.
    map<string, int> m3 = {
        {"grape", 4},
        {"apple", 1}, // Duplicate keys are ignored; the first one wins
        {"date", 5}
    };
    print_map("3. Initializer list", m3);
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Element Access: `operator[]` vs. `at()`

This is a critical topic for `std::map`. These two methods provide access to mapped values, but they behave very differently when a key is not found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Element Access: operator[] vs. at() ---" << endl;
    
    map<string, int> scores = {{"Alice", 95}, {"Bob", 88}};

    // --- operator[] ---
    // If the key exists, it returns a reference to its value.
    cout << "Bob's score is: " << scores["Bob"] << endl;
    scores["Bob"] = 90; // We can modify the value
    cout << "Bob's new score is: " << scores["Bob"] << endl;

    // *** DANGER ***: If the key does NOT exist, it INSERTS a new element
    // with that key and a value-initialized value (0 for int), then returns a reference to it.
    cout << "\nAccessing scores[\"Charlie\"] (doesn't exist)..." << endl;
    cout << "Charlie's score: " << scores["Charlie"] << endl;
    
    cout << "Map state after accessing non-existent key with []:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [name, score] : scores) { // C++17 structured binding
        cout << "  - " << name << ": " << score << endl;
    }

    // --- at() (C++11) ---
    // If the key exists, it returns a reference to its value (just like []).
    cout << "\nAlice's score using at(): " << scores.at("Alice") << endl;

    // If the key does NOT exist, it throws a std::out_of_range exception.
    // It does NOT modify the map.
    cout << "Accessing scores.at(\"David\") (doesn't exist)..." << endl;
    try {
        int david_score = scores.at("David");
    } catch (const out_of_range& e) {
        cout << "  Caught exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    
    cout << "Map size is still: " << scores.size() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Member Functions and Methods

##### Modifiers (C++17 additions are highlighted)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    map<int, string> m;

    // 1. insert(): Many forms, here's a common one.
    // Returns std::pair<iterator, bool>
    m.insert({1, "one"});
    m.insert(std::make_pair(2, "two"));
    
    // 2. emplace(): Constructs pair in-place. More efficient.
    m.emplace(3, "three");
    
    // 3. try_emplace() (C++17): Inserts only if the key does not exist.
    // It avoids constructing the value if the key is already present.
    // Returns std::pair<iterator, bool>
    auto res1 = m.try_emplace(3, "THREE-DUPLICATE"); // Fails, key 3 exists
    cout << "try_emplace(3): success = " << boolalpha << res1.second << endl;

    auto res2 = m.try_emplace(4, "four"); // Succeeds
    cout << "try_emplace(4): success = " << boolalpha << res2.second << endl;

    // 4. insert_or_assign() (C++17): The "upsert" operation.
    // If key exists, updates value. If not, inserts new element.
    // Returns std::pair<iterator, bool> (bool is true if insertion happened)
    auto res3 = m.insert_or_assign(3, "THREE-UPDATED"); // Assigns new value
    cout << "insert_or_assign(3): inserted = " << boolalpha << res3.second << endl;
    
    auto res4 = m.insert_or_assign(5, "five"); // Inserts new element
    cout << "insert_or_assign(5): inserted = " << boolalpha << res4.second << endl;

    cout << "\nFinal map state: " << endl;
    for(const auto& [key, val] : m) cout << "  {" << key << ", " << val << "}" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

##### Lookup Operations

These operate identically to `std::set`, searching based on the key.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    map<string, int> m = {{"apple", 10}, {"banana", 20}, {"cherry", 30}, {"date", 40}};
    
    // find()
    auto it = m.find("banana");
    if (it != m.end()) {
        cout << "Found \"banana\" with value " << it->second << endl;
    }
    
    // contains() (C++20)
    #if __cplusplus >= 202002L
        cout << "C++20 contains(\"cherry\"): " << boolalpha << m.contains("cherry") << endl;
        cout << "C++20 contains(\"fig\"): " << boolalpha << m.contains("fig") << endl;
    #endif
    
    // lower_bound() / upper_bound() for range queries on keys
    cout << "\nItems with keys >= \"banana\" and < \"date\":" << endl;
    auto start = m.lower_bound("banana");
    auto end = m.upper_bound("cherry"); // upper_bound("cherry") is "date"
    
    for (auto current = start; current != end; ++current) {
        cout << "  - " << current->first << ": " << current->second << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Iterators and Algorithms

Iterating over a `map` yields key-value pairs. The modern C++17 way to do this is with structured bindings.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    
    map<string, int> populations = {
        {"China", 1444},
        {"India", 1393},
        {"USA", 332}
    };
    
    cout << "--- Iteration with Structured Bindings (C++17) ---" << endl;
    for (const auto& [country, population] : populations) {
        cout << "The population of " << country << " is " << population << " million." << endl;
    }
    
    cout << "\n--- Traditional Iteration (pre-C++17) ---" << endl;
    for (auto it = populations.begin(); it != populations.end(); ++it) {
        const string& country = it->first;  // The key
        int& population = it->second;       // The value (note it's a non-const reference!)
        
        cout << "The population of " << country << " is " << population << " million." << endl;
        
        // We can modify the value through the iterator
        population += 1;
    }
    
    cout << "\nPopulations after modification:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [country, population] : populations) {
        cout << "  " << country << ": " << population << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Choose Your Access Method Wisely:**
      * **`operator[]`:** Use when you intend to insert or update. Be aware it will default-construct an element if the key is missing.
      * **`.at()`:** Use for read-only access when you are certain the key exists. It provides safety by throwing an exception for missing keys.
      * **`.find()`:** Use for read-only access when the key might be missing. Checking the returned iterator against `.end()` is the canonical way to handle this.
  * **Embrace C++17:** `insert_or_assign` and `try_emplace` are powerful, expressive, and can prevent subtle bugs or performance issues related to `operator[]` and `insert`. Use them when your logic matches their purpose.
  * **Use Structured Bindings for Iteration:** The `for (const auto& [key, value] : my_map)` syntax introduced in C++17 is significantly cleaner and less error-prone than manual access to `.first` and `.second`.
  * **`map` vs. `unordered_map`:** This is the most common decision for a dictionary structure. The default choice in modern C++ is often `std::unordered_map` due to its superior average-case performance. Only use `std::map` if you specifically need the features it provides: sorted keys, the ability to do range queries, or a 100% guarantee against worst-case $O(N)$ performance.

-----

`std::map` is an essential tool for any C++ programmer, providing a robust, sorted dictionary. Its logarithmic performance makes it reliable for a huge variety of applications.

Next, we will look at its sibling, `std::multimap`, which, just as `multiset` relates to `set`, relaxes the rule of unique keys.

Of course. Let's proceed.

Having mastered `std::map` for unique key-value associations, we now explore its sibling, `std::multimap`. This container applies the same principles of sorted, associative storage but removes the restriction on key uniqueness, making it the perfect tool for modeling one-to-many relationships.

-----

### `std::multimap` - The Ordered One-to-Many Dictionary

#### Introduction

`std::multimap` is an associative container that stores a sorted collection of key-value pairs, and it explicitly **allows multiple entries with the same key**. It is to `std::map` what `std::multiset` is to `std::set`.

  * **Purpose:** To store key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the key, where a single key can be associated with multiple different values.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Duplicate Keys Allowed:** This is the defining feature. For example, you can store `{"user1", "login"}, {"user1", "view_page"}, {"user1", "logout"}`.
      * **Sorted by Key:** All elements are continuously sorted according to the key.
      * **No `operator[]` or `at()`:** This is a critical difference from `std::map`. Since a key like `"user1"` could correspond to multiple values, returning a single reference with `operator[]` is ambiguous. Therefore, these access methods are not provided. Access is performed via iterators.
      * **Key-Value Pairs:** Elements are stored as `std::pair<const Key, T>`.
  * **Underlying Implementation:** A balanced binary search tree (e.g., Red-Black Tree), just like its `set` and `map` counterparts.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Insertion (`insert`):** $O(\\log N)$.
      * **Deletion (`erase(key)`):** $O(\\log N + K)$, where K is the number of elements with that key.
      * **Search (`find`, `equal_range`):** $O(\\log N)$.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::map`:** Use `map` for strict one-to-one relationships (a user ID and a username). Use `multimap` for one-to-many relationships (a user ID and all of their logged actions).
      * **vs. `std::map<Key, std::vector<T>>`:** This is a very common alternative.
          * Use `multimap` when insertions and deletions of individual values are frequent and you want to iterate over *all* key-value pairs seamlessly.
          * Use `map<Key, vector<T>>` when you often need to grab the *entire collection* of values for a specific key at once, or if the number of values per key is very high (as it avoids storing the key repeatedly).
      * **vs. `std::unordered_multimap`:** `multimap` keeps keys sorted. `unordered_multimap` does not, but offers faster average-case performance ($O(1)$).

-----

#### Header and Syntax

`std::multimap` is defined in the `<map>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::multimap<Key, T, Compare, Allocator> mmap_name;`

  * `Key`: The type of the keys.
  * `T`: The type of the mapped values.
  * `Compare`: The optional comparison function for the keys.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map> // multimap is in the <map> header
#include <string>

int main() {
    // A multimap to store multiple phone numbers for a single person
    std::multimap<std::string, std::string> contacts;

    // A multimap to store student scores, where a student might have multiple scores
    std::multimap<std::string, int> student_scores;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::multimap objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

Constructors are identical to `std::map` but will preserve duplicate keys.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print multimaps
template<typename K, typename V, typename C>
void print_mmap(const std::string& name, const std::multimap<K, V, C>& mm) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << mm.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& [key, val] : mm) { // C++17 structured binding
        std::cout << "{" << key << ": " << val << "} ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    multimap<string, int> mm1;
    mm1.insert({"math", 90});
    mm1.insert({"science", 95});
    mm1.insert({"math", 85}); // Duplicate key is allowed
    print_mmap("1. Default", mm1);

    // 2. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    multimap<string, int> mm2 = {
        {"bob", 101},
        {"alice", 100},
        {"bob", 102}, // Allowed
        {"charlie", 103}
    };
    print_mmap("2. Initializer list", mm2);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Element Access and Lookup

The absence of `operator[]` and `at()` means all lookups are performed using iterator-based functions. The `equal_range` method is the most important tool in the `multimap` toolkit.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Lookup and Access ---" << endl;
    
    multimap<string, string> schedule = {
        {"Monday", "Work"},
        {"Tuesday", "Gym"},
        {"Monday", "Groceries"},
        {"Wednesday", "Work"},
        {"Monday", "Dentist"}
    };
    
    // 1. NO operator[] or at()
    // The following would be compile errors:
    // auto val = schedule["Monday"];
    // auto val = schedule.at("Monday");

    // 2. count(): Find how many values are associated with a key.
    cout << "Tasks for Monday: " << schedule.count("Monday") << endl;
    
    // 3. find(): Returns an iterator to the FIRST element with the given key.
    auto it_find = schedule.find("Monday");
    if (it_find != schedule.end()) {
        cout << "First task for Monday is: \"" << it_find->second << "\"" << endl;
    }
    
    // 4. equal_range(): The canonical way to get all values for a key.
    // It returns a pair of iterators defining the range [first, last).
    cout << "\nAll tasks for Monday:" << endl;
    auto range = schedule.equal_range("Monday");
    for (auto it = range.first; it != range.second; ++it) {
        cout << "  - " << it->second << endl;
    }
    
    cout << "\nAll tasks for Tuesday (using structured bindings):" << endl;
    auto [start, end] = schedule.equal_range("Tuesday");
    for (auto it = start; it != end; ++it) {
        cout << "  - " << it->second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Modifiers and Iteration

The `erase` method has the same important distinction as in `multiset`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Modifiers and Iteration ---" << endl;

    multimap<string, int> scores;
    
    // 1. insert() / emplace() always adds a new element.
    scores.insert({"Alice", 90});
    scores.insert({"Alice", 95});
    scores.emplace("Bob", 88);
    scores.emplace("Alice", 82);

    cout << "Initial scores:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [name, score] : scores) {
        cout << "  " << name << ": " << score << endl;
    }
    
    // 2. erase(key): Erases ALL key-value pairs with that key.
    size_t num_erased = scores.erase("Alice");
    cout << "\nErased " << num_erased << " entries for \"Alice\"." << endl;
    
    cout << "\nScores after erasing all of Alice's entries:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [name, score] : scores) {
        cout << "  " << name << ": " << score << endl;
    }

    // 3. erase(iterator): Erases just the ONE element at the iterator's position.
    scores.insert({"Charlie", 70});
    scores.insert({"Charlie", 75});
    scores.insert({"Charlie", 80});

    auto it_charlie = scores.find("Charlie"); // Finds the first entry for Charlie (score 70)
    if (it_charlie != scores.end()) {
        scores.erase(it_charlie); // Erase only that one entry
    }
    
    cout << "\nScores after erasing just one of Charlie's entries:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [name, score] : scores) {
        cout << "  " << name << ": " << score << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example: `multimap` vs `map<Key, vector>`

Let's compare the two main approaches for one-to-many relationships.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Helper function to print a map of vectors
template<typename K, typename V>
void print_map_of_vec(const std::string& name, const std::map<K, std::vector<V>>& m) {
    std::cout << name << ": { ";
    for (const auto& [key, vec] : m) {
        std::cout << "{" << key << ": [ ";
        for (const auto& val : vec) std::cout << val << " ";
        std::cout << "]} ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    
    // Approach 1: std::multimap
    cout << "--- Using std::multimap ---" << endl;
    multimap<string, string> contacts_mmap;
    contacts_mmap.insert({"Alice", "555-1234"});
    contacts_mmap.insert({"Bob", "555-5678"});
    contacts_mmap.insert({"Alice", "555-8765"});
    
    cout << "Alice's numbers:" << endl;
    auto range = contacts_mmap.equal_range("Alice");
    for (auto it = range.first; it != range.second; ++it) {
        cout << "  " << it->second << endl;
    }

    // Approach 2: std::map<string, vector<string>>
    cout << "\n--- Using std::map<string, vector<string>> ---" << endl;
    map<string, vector<string>> contacts_map_vec;
    contacts_map_vec["Alice"].push_back("555-1234");
    contacts_map_vec["Bob"].push_back("555-5678");
    contacts_map_vec["Alice"].push_back("555-8765");
    
    cout << "Alice's numbers:" << endl;
    const auto& alice_numbers = contacts_map_vec.at("Alice"); // Use .at() for safe access
    for (const auto& num : alice_numbers) {
        cout << "  " << num << endl;
    }
    
    print_map_of_vec("\nFinal state of map<vec>", contacts_map_vec);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use `multimap` for Sorted One-to-Many Mappings:** It is the ideal tool when your problem domain requires associating a key with multiple values *and* maintaining a sorted order of keys. A classic example is building an index for a book, where each word (key) maps to all the page numbers (values) on which it appears.
  * **Master `equal_range`:** This is the primary and most idiomatic way to work with `multimap`. It safely and efficiently gives you access to all values for a given key.
  * **Be Intentional with `erase`:** The `erase(key)` vs. `erase(iterator)` behavior is a frequent source of bugs. Be absolutely sure of your intent: do you want to remove all entries for a key, or just one specific entry?
  * **Choosing Between `multimap` and `map<Key, vector<T>>`:**
      * **`multimap` shines when:** You have streaming data, frequently adding or removing individual key-value pairs, and want easy iteration over the entire collection in sorted order.
      * **`map<Key, vector<T>>` shines when:** You frequently need to access the *entire list* of values for a key as a single unit, or when the number of values per key is extremely high (saving memory by not repeating the key in every node).

The four ordered associative containers—`set`, `multiset`, `map`, and `multimap`—form a complete and logical family based on the principles of balanced binary search trees. They provide powerful, reliable, and efficient ways to manage sorted data.

Our journey through the STL now leads us to the second major category of associative containers: the **unordered associative containers**. These containers prioritize average-case speed over sorted order by using a completely different underlying data structure: the hash table. We will begin with `std::unordered_set`.

Excellent. Our exploration of the STL has brought us through the sequence containers and the ordered associative containers. Now, we enter the realm of hash tables. These containers prioritize raw speed over order, offering the fastest possible average-case performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions.

We'll begin with the hash-based equivalent of `std::set`: `std::unordered_set`.

-----

### `std::unordered_set` - The Hashed Set of Unique Keys

#### Introduction

`std::unordered_set` is an associative container that stores a collection of unique elements in no particular order. Instead of a balanced tree, its underlying implementation is a **hash table**. This fundamental difference in data structure gives it a distinct performance profile compared to `std::set`.

  * **Purpose:** To provide the fastest possible average-case time complexity for adding, removing, and finding unique elements when the order of elements is not important.
  * **How it Works (The Hash Table):**
    1.  **Hashing:** When you insert an element, a special *hash function* is applied to its value, converting it into an integer hash code.
    2.  **Buckets:** This hash code is used to determine which "bucket" (an index in an internal array) the element should be placed in.
    3.  **Collisions:** If two different elements hash to the same bucket, it's called a collision. The `unordered_set` handles this by storing multiple elements in the same bucket (typically as a small linked list).
    4.  **Rehashing:** To maintain efficiency, if the number of elements grows too large for the current number of buckets (i.e., the *load factor* is too high), the container allocates a larger array of buckets and rehashes all existing elements into the new table.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Unordered:** Elements are not sorted. The order in which you iterate through them is arbitrary and may change whenever the container is modified.
      * **Unique Keys:** Like `std::set`, duplicates are not allowed.
      * **Fast Average Time:** The hash table structure allows for extremely fast operations on average.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Search (`find`), Insertion (`insert`), and Deletion (`erase`):**
          * **Average Case:** $O(1)$ - Constant time.
          * **Worst Case:** $O(N)$ - Linear time. This occurs if a poor hash function causes all elements to collide into a single bucket, effectively turning the hash table into a slow linked list.
  * **Comparison to `std::set`:**
      * **Speed vs. Order:** This is the core trade-off. `unordered_set` is generally much faster ($O(1)$ vs. $O(\\log N)$). `std::set` keeps elements sorted.
      * **Performance Guarantee:** `std::set` provides a *guaranteed* logarithmic worst-case performance. `unordered_set`'s worst-case is linear, though rare in practice with good hash functions.
      * **API Differences:** `std::set` has order-based lookup functions like `lower_bound`, which `unordered_set` lacks. `unordered_set` has hash-policy functions like `load_factor` and `reserve`.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::unordered_set`, you must include the `<unordered_set>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::unordered_set<Key, Hash, KeyEqual, Allocator> uset_name;`

  * `Key`: The type of the elements.
  * `Hash`: The hash function object. Defaults to `std::hash<Key>`. The STL provides specializations for all fundamental types and some library types like `std::string`.
  * `KeyEqual`: The equality comparison function. Defaults to `std::equal_to<Key>`, which uses `operator==`.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // An unordered_set of integers
    std::unordered_set<int> int_uset;

    // An unordered_set of strings
    std::unordered_set<std::string> string_uset;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::unordered_set objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

The constructors are similar to `std::set`, with additional options to control the initial hash table size.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print unordered_sets
template<typename T, typename H, typename E>
void print_uset(const std::string& name, const std::unordered_set<T, H, E>& us) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << us.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : us) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    unordered_set<int> us1;
    us1.insert(10);
    us1.insert(5);
    us1.insert(20);
    print_uset("1. Default", us1); // Note: Order is not guaranteed to be {5 10 20}

    // 2. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {50, 20, 80, 20, 50}; // Duplicates will be ignored
    unordered_set<int> us2(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_uset("2. Range (from vector)", us2);

    // 3. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    unordered_set<int> us3 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 6, 8}; // Duplicates ignored
    print_uset("3. Initializer list", us3);
    
    // 4. Constructor with initial bucket count
    unordered_set<int> us4(100); // Creates an empty set with at least 100 buckets
    cout << "4. Initial bucket count: " << us4.bucket_count() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Member Functions and Methods

The interface is nearly identical to `std::set` for common operations, but it adds a new category of functions for managing the hash table policy.

##### Lookup, Insert, and Erase

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    unordered_set<string> us;
    
    // insert() returns std::pair<iterator, bool>
    us.insert("apple");
    us.insert("banana");
    us.insert("apple"); // Fails, returns false
    
    // find() returns iterator or .end()
    if (us.find("apple") != us.end()) {
        cout << "\"apple\" is in the set." << endl;
    }
    
    // count() returns 1 or 0
    cout << "Count of \"banana\": " << us.count("banana") << endl;
    
    #if __cplusplus >= 202002L
        // contains() (C++20) is the preferred way to check for existence
        cout << "Set contains \"cherry\": " << boolalpha << us.contains("cherry") << endl;
    #endif
        
    // erase() by key
    us.erase("banana");
    
    cout << "Set contents: ";
    for(const auto& val : us) cout << val << " "; cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

##### Hash Policy and Bucket Interface

These functions give you control over the underlying hash table structure, which is key for performance tuning.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Hash Policy and Buckets ---" << endl;
    
    unordered_set<int> us;
    
    // 1. reserve(): A key performance function.
    // Sets the number of buckets to be appropriate for holding at least N elements.
    // Use this to avoid automatic rehashing if you know the number of elements in advance.
    cout << "Initial bucket count: " << us.bucket_count() << endl;
    us.reserve(100);
    cout << "Bucket count after reserve(100): " << us.bucket_count() << endl;

    for(int i = 0; i < 50; ++i) us.insert(i * 10);
    
    // 2. load_factor(): Current number of elements divided by bucket count.
    cout << "\nCurrent size: " << us.size() << endl;
    cout << "Current bucket count: " << us.bucket_count() << endl;
    cout << "Current load_factor: " << us.load_factor() << endl;
    
    // 3. max_load_factor(): Get or set the threshold that triggers a rehash.
    cout << "Current max_load_factor: " << us.max_load_factor() << endl;
    us.max_load_factor(0.5f); // Lower it to trigger rehashes sooner
    
    // 4. bucket(key): Find which bucket a key belongs in.
    cout << "\nKey 200 is in bucket: " << us.bucket(200) << endl;
    cout << "Key 333 is in bucket: " << us.bucket(333) << endl;
    
    // 5. bucket_size(n): See how many elements are in a bucket (check for collisions).
    size_t bucket_num = us.bucket(200);
    cout << "Number of elements in bucket " << bucket_num << ": " << us.bucket_size(bucket_num) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Custom Types in `unordered_set`

To use a custom type (like a `struct` or `class`) in an `unordered_set`, you **must** provide two things:

1.  An equality operator (`operator==`) so the set can tell if two elements are the same.
2.  A hash function, typically by specializing the `std::hash` template for your type.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

// A custom struct we want to store
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
    
    // 1. Provide an equality operator
    bool operator==(const Person& other) const {
        return name == other.name && age == other.age;
    }
};

// 2. Provide a hash function by specializing std::hash
namespace std {
    template<>
    struct hash<Person> {
        size_t operator()(const Person& p) const {
            // A common way to combine hashes of members
            size_t h1 = std::hash<string>()(p.name);
            size_t h2 = std::hash<int>()(p.age);
            // A simple combining algorithm
            return h1 ^ (h2 << 1); 
        }
    };
}


int main() {
    using namespace std;
    
    unordered_set<Person> people;
    
    people.insert({"Alice", 25});
    people.insert({"Bob", 30});
    people.insert({"Alice", 25}); // This is a duplicate and will be ignored
    
    cout << "People in the set:" << endl;
    for (const auto& p : people) {
        cout << "  - " << p.name << " (" << p.age << ")" << endl;
    }
    
    // Check for existence
    Person alice = {"Alice", 25};
    if (people.count(alice)) {
        cout << "\nThe set contains Alice, age 25." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Default to `unordered_set`:** When you need a set of unique items and order is not a requirement, `std::unordered_set` should be your default choice over `std::set`. Its $O(1)$ average complexity makes it significantly faster for most common use cases.
  * **Always `reserve()` When Possible:** If you have an estimate of how many elements you will insert, call `us.reserve(N)` before your insertion loop. This single action can dramatically improve performance by preventing multiple, slow rehashing operations.
  * **Master Custom Hashing:** To use `unordered_set` to its full potential, you must be comfortable making your own types hashable. The pattern is always the same: define `operator==` and specialize `std::hash`.
  * **A Good Hash Function is Key:** The performance of a hash table depends entirely on its hash function. A good function distributes elements evenly across the buckets, minimizing collisions. A poor function can lead to many collisions and degrade performance to the $O(N)$ worst case.
  * **No Relational Operators:** Remember that `unordered_set` does not have `operator<`, `operator>`, etc., because it has no inherent order. It only supports `operator==` and `operator!=` (in C++20).

-----

`std::unordered_set` is the high-speed workhorse for managing unique collections. Its average-case constant-time performance makes it an essential tool for performance-sensitive applications.

Next, we'll look at its logical counterpart, `std::unordered_multiset`, which removes the uniqueness constraint while keeping all the benefits and characteristics of a hash table.

Of course. Let's continue.

We've just covered `std::unordered_set`, the high-speed container for unique items. Now we'll look at its direct sibling, `std::unordered_multiset`, which takes the same hash-table foundation and removes the uniqueness constraint.

-----

### `std::unordered_multiset` - The Hashed Bag of Keys

#### Introduction

`std::unordered_multiset` is an associative container that stores a collection of elements, which may not be unique, in no particular order. It is implemented as a hash table, just like `std::unordered_set`, and offers the same stellar average-case performance. Think of it as a digital "bag" or "bucket" where you can throw items, duplicates are allowed, and order doesn't matter.

  * **Purpose:** To provide the fastest possible average-case time complexity for adding, removing, and finding elements when order is not important and duplicates must be stored.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Unordered:** Elements are not sorted. Iteration order is arbitrary.
      * **Duplicate Keys Allowed:** The defining feature. You can store multiple identical elements.
      * **Fast Average Time:** Built on a hash table for $O(1)$ average-case performance.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Search (`find`), Insertion (`insert`):**
          * **Average Case:** $O(1)$.
          * **Worst Case:** $O(N)$.
      * **Counting (`count`):** Average case is $O(K)$ where K is the number of matching elements.
      * **Deletion (`erase(key)`):** Average case is $O(K)$ where K is the number of elements erased.
  * **Comparison to Similar Containers:**
      * **vs. `std::unordered_set`:** The only difference is that `unordered_multiset` allows duplicates.
      * **vs. `std::multiset`:** The classic speed-versus-order trade-off. `multiset` is sorted ($O(\\log N)$). `unordered_multiset` is faster on average ($O(1)$) but unordered.
      * **vs. `std::unordered_map<Key, size_t>`:** A common alternative for frequency counting. The `unordered_map` approach is generally more memory-efficient if the number of duplicates for each key is high. `unordered_multiset` is simpler if you need to store each individual instance.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

`std::unordered_multiset` is also defined in the `<unordered_set>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::unordered_multiset<Key, Hash, KeyEqual, Allocator> umset_name;`

  * The template parameters (`Key`, `Hash`, `KeyEqual`, `Allocator`) are identical to those of `std::unordered_set`.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set> // Also contains unordered_multiset
#include <string>

int main() {
    // An unordered_multiset which can hold duplicate strings
    std::unordered_multiset<std::string> tags;

    // An unordered_multiset of integers representing dice rolls
    std::unordered_multiset<int> dice_rolls;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::unordered_multiset objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

Constructors are identical to `unordered_set` but will preserve duplicates.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print unordered_multisets
template<typename T, typename H, typename E>
void print_umset(const std::string& name, const std::unordered_multiset<T, H, E>& ums) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << ums.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& elem : ums) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    unordered_multiset<int> ums1;
    ums1.insert(10);
    ums1.insert(5);
    ums1.insert(10); // Duplicate is kept
    print_umset("1. Default", ums1);

    // 2. Range Constructor
    vector<int> source_vec = {50, 20, 80, 20, 50}; // All 5 elements will be kept
    unordered_multiset<int> ums2(source_vec.begin(), source_vec.end());
    print_umset("2. Range (from vector)", ums2);

    // 3. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    unordered_multiset<string> ums3 = {"a", "b", "c", "a", "c", "a"};
    print_umset("3. Initializer list", ums3);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Member Functions and Methods

The function signatures are the same as `unordered_set`, but their behavior is adapted for duplicates, much like the `multiset`/`multimap` relationship.

##### Lookup and `equal_range`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Lookup Operations ---" << endl;
    
    unordered_multiset<string> votes = {"candidate_A", "candidate_B", "candidate_A", "candidate_C", "candidate_A"};
    
    // 1. count(): Returns the total number of occurrences.
    cout << "Votes for candidate_A: " << votes.count("candidate_A") << endl; // -> 3
    
    // 2. find(): Returns an iterator to *an* occurrence of the key.
    auto it_find = votes.find("candidate_A");
    if (it_find != votes.end()) {
        cout << "Found an entry for candidate_A." << endl;
    }

    // 3. equal_range(): The primary tool for working with duplicates.
    // Returns a pair of iterators for a range containing ALL elements with that key.
    cout << "\nIterating over all votes for candidate_A using equal_range:" << endl;
    auto range = votes.equal_range("candidate_A");
    for (auto it = range.first; it != range.second; ++it) {
        cout << "  - Found vote: " << *it << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

##### Modifiers and the `erase` Distinction

The behavior of `erase` is critical to understand.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Modifier Functions (Especially erase) ---" << endl;
    
    unordered_multiset<string> inventory = {"potion", "sword", "potion", "shield", "potion"};
    
    cout << "Initial inventory: { ";
    for(const auto& item : inventory) cout << item << " "; cout << "}" << endl;
    
    // 1. insert() always adds a new element.
    inventory.insert("gem");
    
    // 2. erase(key): Erases ALL elements with the given key.
    // Returns the number of elements erased.
    size_t num_erased = inventory.erase("potion");
    cout << "\nUsed (erased) " << num_erased << " potions." << endl;
    
    cout << "Inventory after erasing all potions: { ";
    for(const auto& item : inventory) cout << item << " "; cout << "}" << endl;

    inventory.insert("coin");
    inventory.insert("coin");
    inventory.insert("coin");
    
    cout << "\nInventory state: { ";
    for(const auto& item : inventory) cout << item << " "; cout << "}" << endl;

    // 3. erase(iterator): Erases only the ONE element at the iterator's position.
    auto it_find = inventory.find("coin"); // Find one coin
    if (it_find != inventory.end()) {
        inventory.erase(it_find); // Spend (erase) just that one coin
    }

    cout << "Inventory after spending one coin: { ";
    for(const auto& item : inventory) cout << item << " "; cout << "}" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Custom Types in `unordered_multiset`

The requirements are identical to `std::unordered_set`. To store a custom type, you must provide an `operator==` and a specialization of `std::hash`. The same `Person` example from the `unordered_set` guide would work here perfectly, but it would allow multiple `Person` objects with the same name and age to be stored.

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use for Fast "Bag" Semantics:** `unordered_multiset` is the perfect choice when you need a "bag" of items—a collection where order doesn't matter, duplicates are allowed, and you need to quickly add, remove, or count items.
  * **`equal_range` is the Right Tool:** When you need to find and process all elements with a specific value, `equal_range` is the most direct and efficient method.
  * **Beware `erase(key)`:** Just like with `multiset` and `multimap`, this is a common pitfall. `ums.erase(key)` removes *all* matching items. If you only want to remove one, get an iterator to it first (e.g., via `find()`) and then pass that iterator to `erase()`.
  * **Consider `unordered_map<Key, size_t>` for Frequency Counts:** If your sole purpose is to count items (e.g., word counting), an `unordered_map` is typically more memory-efficient and can be more intuitive (`word_counts[word]++`). Use `unordered_multiset` when you need to store each individual instance for reasons other than just counting.
  * **`reserve()` for Performance:** The advice is identical to `unordered_set`. If you know how many items you'll be adding, `reserve` memory beforehand to prevent costly rehashes.

-----

`std::unordered_multiset` completes the `set` family of containers, providing a high-performance solution for managing non-unique, unordered collections.

We now arrive at the final primary associative container: `std::unordered_map`. This container combines the key-value pairing of `std::map` with the high-speed hashing of `std::unordered_set`, making it arguably the most commonly used dictionary-style container in modern C++.

Excellent. We have arrived at the final primary container in the STL's associative group. This is arguably the most frequently used associative container in modern C++: `std::unordered_map`. It combines the fast, hash-based lookups of `std::unordered_set` with the key-value pairing of `std::map`.

-----

### `std::unordered_map` - The Hashed Key-Value Dictionary

#### Introduction

`std::unordered_map` is an associative container that stores unique key-value pairs in no particular order. It is implemented as a hash table, making it the highest-performance dictionary structure in the STL for average-case scenarios. It is the modern default choice for most key-value mapping tasks.

  * **Purpose:** To provide the fastest possible average-case time complexity for storing and retrieving values associated with a unique key, when the order of keys is not important.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
      * **Key-Value Pairs:** Elements are stored as `std::pair<const Key, T>`.
      * **Unordered:** Keys are not sorted. The order of elements is determined by their hash values and the internal state of the hash table.
      * **Unique Keys:** Like `std::map`, no two elements can have the same key.
      * **Fast Average Time:** Its hash table implementation provides $O(1)$ average time complexity for most operations.
      * **`operator[]`:** Provides convenient access to mapped values, with the same "access or insert" behavior as `std::map`.
  * **Time Complexities:**
      * **Access (`[]`, `at`), Search (`find`), Insertion (`insert`), and Deletion (`erase`):**
          * **Average Case:** $O(1)$ - Constant time.
          * **Worst Case:** $O(N)$ - Linear time (in the rare case of widespread hash collisions).
  * **Comparison to `std::map`:**
      * **Speed vs. Order:** This is the critical trade-off. `unordered_map` is generally much faster ($O(1)$ vs. $O(\\log N)$). `std::map` keeps keys sorted.
      * **Default Choice:** In modern C++, `std::unordered_map` is often the default choice for a dictionary unless you specifically need sorted keys (e.g., for iterating in order or for range-based queries like `lower_bound`).

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::unordered_map`, you must include the `<unordered_map>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::unordered_map<Key, T, Hash, KeyEqual, Allocator> umap_name;`

  * `Key`: The type of the keys.
  * `T`: The type of the mapped values.
  * `Hash`: The hash function object for the keys. Defaults to `std::hash<Key>`.
  * `KeyEqual`: The equality comparison function for the keys. Defaults to `std::equal_to<Key>`.
  * `Allocator`: The optional custom memory allocator.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // An unordered_map from strings to integers (e.g., for frequency counting)
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> word_counts;

    // An unordered_map from user IDs (int) to user profiles (a custom struct)
    // struct UserProfile { /* ... */ };
    // std::unordered_map<int, UserProfile> users;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::unordered_map objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

Constructors mirror those of `std::map`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to print unordered_maps
template<typename K, typename V, typename H, typename E>
void print_umap(const std::string& name, const std::unordered_map<K, V, H, E>& um) {
    std::cout << name << " (size=" << um.size() << "): { ";
    for (const auto& [key, val] : um) { // C++17 structured binding
        std::cout << "{" << key << ": " << val << "} ";
    }
    std::cout << "}" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor
    unordered_map<string, int> um1;
    um1["one"] = 1;
    um1["two"] = 2;
    print_umap("1. Default", um1);

    // 2. Initializer List Constructor (C++11)
    unordered_map<string, int> um2 = {
        {"banana", 2},
        {"apple", 1},
        {"cherry", 3},
        {"apple", 99} // The first "apple" is overwritten by the last one
    };
    print_umap("2. Initializer list", um2);

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Element Access: `operator[]` vs. `at()` vs. `find()`

Choosing the correct access method is crucial for writing correct and efficient code with `unordered_map`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Access Methods ---" << endl;
    
    unordered_map<string, int> scores = {{"Alice", 95}, {"Bob", 88}};
    
    // 1. operator[]: For writing or when default insertion is acceptable.
    // If "Bob" exists, returns a reference to his score.
    scores["Bob"] = 92; // Update Bob's score
    // If "Charlie" does not exist, it inserts {"Charlie", 0} and returns a reference to the 0.
    scores["Charlie"]++; // Conveniently initializes to 0, then increments to 1.
    
    cout << "Scores after using []:" << endl;
    for(const auto& [name, score] : scores) cout << "  " << name << ": " << score << endl;
    
    // 2. at(): For safe read/write access when you expect the key to exist.
    // Throws std::out_of_range if the key does not exist.
    try {
        cout << "\nAlice's score is " << scores.at("Alice") << endl;
        scores.at("Alice") = 98; // Can also modify
        cout << "Alice's new score is " << scores.at("Alice") << endl;
        
        cout << "Trying to access David's score..." << endl;
        int david_score = scores.at("David"); // This will throw
    } catch (const out_of_range& e) {
        cout << "  Caught exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    
    // 3. find(): For read-only access when the key might not exist.
    // This is the most efficient way to check for a key without modifying the map.
    cout << "\nChecking for Bob and David with find():" << endl;
    auto it_bob = scores.find("Bob");
    if (it_bob != scores.end()) {
        cout << "  Found Bob with score " << it_bob->second << endl;
    }
    
    auto it_david = scores.find("David");
    if (it_david == scores.end()) {
        cout << "  David was not found in the map." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Member Functions (including Hash Policy)

The interface includes the same powerful C++17 additions as `std::map` and the hash table management functions from `std::unordered_set`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    unordered_map<int, string> um;
    
    // insert() and emplace() are the standard ways to add elements
    um.insert({1, "one"});
    um.emplace(2, "two");

    // try_emplace() (C++17) is efficient for inserting without overwriting
    um.try_emplace(3, "three"); // Inserts
    um.try_emplace(1, "ONE");   // Does nothing, key 1 already exists
    
    // insert_or_assign() (C++17) is the "upsert" operation
    um.insert_or_assign(1, "ONE-UPDATED"); // Overwrites value for key 1
    
    cout << "Map state:" << endl;
    for(const auto& [k, v] : um) cout << "  {" << k << ": " << v << "}" << endl;

    // Hash Policy functions are vital for performance tuning
    cout << "\n--- Hash Policy ---" << endl;
    unordered_map<int, int> perf_map;
    
    // Use reserve() to pre-allocate buckets and prevent rehashing
    size_t num_elements = 1000;
    perf_map.reserve(num_elements);
    cout << "Bucket count after reserving for " << num_elements << " elements: " << perf_map.bucket_count() << endl;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) perf_map[i] = i * i;
    
    cout << "Load factor after insertions: " << perf_map.load_factor() << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Custom Key in `unordered_map`

Just like `unordered_set`, using a custom type as a key requires defining both `operator==` and a specialization for `std::hash`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

// A custom struct for our key
struct Point {
    int x, y;
    
    // 1. Equality Operator
    bool operator==(const Point& other) const {
        return x == other.x && y == other.y;
    }
};

// 2. Hash function specialization
namespace std {
    template<>
    struct hash<Point> {
        size_t operator()(const Point& p) const {
            // A simple way to combine hashes of members
            size_t hx = std::hash<int>()(p.x);
            size_t hy = std::hash<int>()(p.y);
            return hx ^ (hy << 1);
        }
    };
}

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    
    // Now we can use Point as a key
    unordered_map<Point, string> city_locations;
    
    Point p1 = {10, 20};
    city_locations[p1] = "City A";
    
    city_locations.insert({{30, 40}, "City B"});
    
    cout << "City at {10, 20}: " << city_locations.at({10, 20}) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **`unordered_map` is the Default Dictionary:** For any general-purpose key-value mapping (dictionaries, look-up tables), `std::unordered_map` should be your default choice. Only switch to `std::map` if you have a specific, identified need for sorted keys.
  * **Master the Access Methods:** Understand the difference between `[]`, `at()`, and `find()`. Using the right one for the job prevents bugs (like accidental insertions with `[]`) and improves clarity.
  * **`reserve()` is Your \#1 Performance Tool:** If you know the approximate number of elements you'll be storing, calling `reserve()` before inserting is the single most effective way to optimize `unordered_map` performance by eliminating rehashes.
  * **Make Custom Types Hashable:** To unlock the full power of `unordered_map`, you must be able to use your own data types as keys. The pattern is always the same: provide `operator==` and specialize `std::hash`.
  * **Use Structured Bindings:** The C++17 `for (const auto& [key, value] : my_map)` syntax is the cleanest, most modern, and most readable way to iterate over a map.

-----

We have now covered all eight of the primary associative containers. The ordered family (`set`, `multiset`, `map`, `multimap`) provides guaranteed logarithmic performance and sorted data, while the unordered family (`unordered_set`, `unordered_multiset`, `unordered_map`, `unordered_multimap`) provides faster average-case constant-time performance for when order is not a concern.

Our comprehensive tour now moves to a different category of STL components: the **container adaptors**. These are not full containers themselves but are wrappers around underlying containers (like `vector` or `deque`) to provide a specific, restricted interface, such as LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) or FIFO (First-In, First-Out). We will begin with `std::stack`.

Of course. Let's continue.

We have now completed our in-depth tour of the STL's primary containers. Our focus now shifts to a different kind of component: **container adaptors**. These are not containers themselves but are templated classes that wrap an underlying container to provide a specific, restricted interface. They don't add new functionality but instead limit the existing functionality to enforce a certain access pattern.

We'll begin with the simplest and most well-known adaptor: `std::stack`.

-----

### `std::stack` - The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Adaptor

#### Introduction

`std::stack` is a container adaptor that provides a strict Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) interface. Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add a new plate to the top, and you can only take a plate from the top. The last plate you put on is the first one you take off.

  * **Purpose:** To enforce a LIFO data access policy. It's used for algorithms where you need to process items in the reverse order of their arrival.
  * **Container Adaptor, Not a Container:** This is a crucial distinction. A `std::stack` does not actually store elements itself. It holds an underlying container (like `std::deque` or `std::vector`) and simply provides a limited set of functions (`push`, `pop`, `top`) that call the corresponding functions on that container (`push_back`, `pop_back`, `back`).
  * **Restricted Interface:** The primary feature of `std::stack` is what it *doesn't* let you do. You cannot access elements by index, you cannot insert into the middle, and most importantly, you **cannot iterate** over the elements. This restriction makes code safer and clearer by guaranteeing LIFO behavior.
  * **Underlying Container:**
      * By default, `std::stack` uses `std::deque` as its underlying container.
      * You can also use `std::vector` or `std::list`. The chosen container must provide the member functions `back()`, `push_back()`, and `pop_back()`.
  * **Time Complexities:** The complexity of stack operations is identical to the complexity of the corresponding operations on the underlying container. For the default `std::deque` (and for `std::vector`), all stack operations are amortized $O(1)$.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::stack`, you must include the `<stack>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::stack<T, Container> stack_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the stack will hold.
  * `Container`: The type of the underlying container. This is optional and defaults to `std::deque<T>`.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

int main() {
    // A stack of integers using the default container (std::deque<int>)
    std::stack<int> s1;

    // A stack of strings using std::vector<string> as the underlying container
    std::stack<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> s2;

    // A stack of doubles using std::list<double>
    std::stack<double, std::list<double>> s3;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::stack objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

A stack is typically created empty, but it can also be initialized by copying or moving an existing compatible container.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor (creates an empty stack)
    stack<int> s1;
    s1.push(10);

    // 2. Initializing from an existing container (Copy)
    deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    stack<int, deque<int>> s2(d); // s2 is now a stack with 5 on top
    cout << "Top of s2 (initialized from deque): " << s2.top() << endl;

    // 3. Initializing from an existing container (Move)
    vector<int> v = {100, 200, 300};
    stack<int, vector<int>> s3(std::move(v));
    cout << "Top of s3 (initialized from vector): " << s3.top() << endl;
    cout << "Size of vector after move: " << v.size() << endl; // v is now empty or unspecified

    // 4. Copy Constructor
    stack<int, deque<int>> s4 = s2;
    cout << "Top of s4 (copy of s2): " << s4.top() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### All Member Functions and Methods

The interface for `std::stack` is intentionally small and simple.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Member Functions ---" << endl;
    
    stack<string> s;
    
    // 1. empty(): Checks if the stack has no elements.
    cout << "Is stack empty initially? " << boolalpha << s.empty() << endl;
    
    // --- Modifiers ---
    // 2. push(): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    s.push("apple");
    s.push("banana");
    
    // 3. emplace() (C++11): Constructs an element in-place at the top.
    s.emplace("cherry");

    // --- Capacity ---
    // 4. size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.
    cout << "Size of stack: " << s.size() << endl;
    cout << "Is stack empty now? " << boolalpha << s.empty() << endl;
    
    // --- Element Access ---
    // 5. top(): Returns a reference to the top element.
    // IMPORTANT: It does NOT remove the element.
    // Calling top() on an empty stack is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.
    if (!s.empty()) {
        cout << "Top element is: " << s.top() << endl; // -> "cherry"
        // We can modify the top element through the reference
        s.top() = "cherry-pie";
        cout << "Top element after modification: " << s.top() << endl;
    }
    
    // --- More Modifiers ---
    // 6. pop(): Removes the top element.
    // IMPORTANT: It has a void return type. It does not return the element.
    s.pop(); // Removes "cherry-pie"
    
    cout << "\nAfter one pop, the new top element is: " << s.top() << endl; // -> "banana"
    
    // The correct sequence to get and remove an element:
    string value = s.top();
    s.pop();
    cout << "Correctly retrieved and removed \"" << value << "\"" << endl;
    cout << "Final top element: " << s.top() << endl; // -> "apple"
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Iterators and Algorithms

`std::stack` **does not provide iterators**. This is by design. The purpose of the adaptor is to prevent any operation other than LIFO access.

  * You cannot use a range-based `for` loop.
  * You cannot pass a stack's "begin" and "end" to an STL algorithm.

The only way to process all elements in a stack is to destructively `pop()` them one by one until the stack is `empty()`.

-----

#### Example: Balanced Parentheses

The classic computer science problem of checking for balanced parentheses is a perfect demonstration of a stack's utility.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

bool is_balanced(const std::string& expression) {
    std::stack<char> s;
    const std::unordered_map<char, char> pairs = {
        {')', '('},
        {']', '['},
        {'}', '{'}
    };

    for (char c : expression) {
        if (c == '(' || c == '[' || c == '{') {
            // If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
            s.push(c);
        } else if (c == ')' || c == ']' || c == '}') {
            // If it's a closing bracket:
            // 1. The stack can't be empty.
            // 2. The top of the stack must be the matching opening bracket.
            if (s.empty() || s.top() != pairs.at(c)) {
                return false;
            }
            // If they match, pop the opening bracket.
            s.pop();
        }
    }
    
    // If the expression is balanced, the stack must be empty at the end.
    return s.empty();
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "--- Example: Balanced Parentheses ---" << std::endl;
    
    std::string expr1 = "({[]})";
    std::string expr2 = "([)]";
    std::string expr3 = "{[}";
    std::string expr4 = "hello() world";
    
    std::cout << "\"" << expr1 << "\" is balanced? " << std::boolalpha << is_balanced(expr1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "\"" << expr2 << "\" is balanced? " << std::boolalpha << is_balanced(expr2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "\"" << expr3 << "\" is balanced? " << std::boolalpha << is_balanced(expr3) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "\"" << expr4 << "\" is balanced? " << std::boolalpha << is_balanced(expr4) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use `std::stack` to Enforce LIFO:** When your algorithm's correctness depends on a LIFO policy (e.g., parsing, recursive-to-iterative algorithm conversion, depth-first search), use `std::stack`. It makes your code's intent clear and prevents accidental misuse of the underlying container.
  * **Always Check `!empty()`:** This is the most critical safety rule. Before calling `top()` or `pop()`, you must ensure the stack is not empty to avoid undefined behavior.
  * **Remember the `top()`/`pop()` Two-Step:** A common beginner mistake is assuming `pop()` returns the removed element. It does not. The correct pattern is to get the element with `top()`, then remove it with `pop()`.
  * **Choosing the Underlying Container:**
      * `std::deque` (default): A great general-purpose choice.
      * `std::vector`: Can be slightly more memory-efficient if you know the maximum size of the stack and can `reserve` capacity on the vector before creating the stack, but this is an advanced pattern.
      * `std::list`: Use only in the rare case that you need pointer stability for the elements stored in the stack, as it has higher overhead than the others.
  * **No Iteration, No Problem:** If you find yourself needing to iterate through the elements, you don't need a stack. You need a `std::vector` or `std::deque`. A stack is the wrong tool for that job.

-----

`std::stack` is a simple but powerful tool for managing data in a LIFO manner. Its restrictive interface is its greatest strength, leading to safer and more readable code.

Next, we will look at its sibling adaptor, `std::queue`, which provides the opposite access pattern: First-In, First-Out (FIFO).

Of course. Let's continue with the next container adaptor.

After examining `std::stack` and its Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) discipline, we'll now look at its counterpart, `std::queue`. This adaptor enforces the opposite, and equally important, First-In, First-Out (FIFO) access pattern, which models countless real-world scenarios.

-----

### `std::queue` - The First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Adaptor

#### Introduction

`std::queue` is a container adaptor that provides a strict First-In, First-Out (FIFO) interface. This is the behavior of a typical queue or line: the first person to get in line is the first person to be served. The first element added to the `queue` is the first one to be removed.

  * **Purpose:** To enforce a FIFO data access policy. It is essential for algorithms where items must be processed in the exact order they were received, such as task scheduling, event handling, or breadth-first search algorithms.
  * **Container Adaptor:** Like `std::stack`, a `queue` is a wrapper around an underlying container. It does not store elements itself but delegates that job, providing a limited public interface to enforce FIFO behavior.
  * **Restricted Interface:** You can only add elements to the `back` and remove elements from the `front`. You can inspect the `front` and `back` elements, but you cannot iterate through the queue or access any elements in the middle.
  * **Underlying Container:**
      * By default, `std::queue` uses `std::deque` as its underlying container. `deque` is the perfect choice because it offers efficient $O(1)$ operations at both the front (`pop_front`) and the back (`push_back`).
      * You can also use `std::list`.
      * You **cannot** use `std::vector` as the underlying container because `vector` lacks an efficient `pop_front` operation (erasing from the front of a vector is $O(N)$). The container must provide `front()`, `back()`, `push_back()`, and `pop_front()`.
  * **Time Complexities:** The complexity of queue operations is identical to that of the underlying container. For the default `std::deque` (and for `std::list`), all queue operations are $O(1)$.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

To use `std::queue`, you must include the `<queue>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::queue<T, Container> queue_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements the queue will hold.
  * `Container`: The type of the underlying container. This is optional and defaults to `std::deque<T>`.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <list>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    // A queue of integers using the default container (std::deque<int>)
    std::queue<int> q1;

    // A queue of strings using std::list<string> as the underlying container
    std::queue<std::string, std::list<std::string>> q2;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::queue objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

A queue is usually created empty and then filled, but like `stack`, it can be constructed from a compatible container.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <list>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor (creates an empty queue)
    queue<int> q1;
    q1.push(10);

    // 2. Initializing from an existing container (Copy)
    list<int> l = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    queue<int, list<int>> q2(l); // q2 is now a queue with 1 at the front
    cout << "Front of q2 (initialized from list): " << q2.front() << endl;

    // 3. Initializing from an existing container (Move)
    deque<int> d = {100, 200, 300};
    queue<int, deque<int>> q3(std::move(d));
    cout << "Front of q3 (initialized from deque): " << q3.front() << endl;
    cout << "Size of deque after move: " << d.size() << endl; // d is now empty or unspecified

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### All Member Functions and Methods

The interface is minimal, providing only the essential FIFO operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Member Functions ---" << endl;
    
    queue<string> q;
    
    // 1. empty(): Checks if the queue has no elements.
    cout << "Is queue empty initially? " << boolalpha << q.empty() << endl;
    
    // --- Modifiers ---
    // 2. push(): Adds an element to the BACK of the queue.
    q.push("first_in");
    q.push("second_in");
    
    // 3. emplace() (C++11): Constructs an element in-place at the BACK.
    q.emplace("third_in");

    // --- Capacity ---
    // 4. size(): Returns the number of elements.
    cout << "Size of queue: " << q.size() << endl;
    
    // --- Element Access ---
    // 5. front(): Returns a reference to the NEXT element to be removed (the oldest).
    // 6. back(): Returns a reference to the MOST RECENTLY added element.
    // Calling front() or back() on an empty queue is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.
    if (!q.empty()) {
        cout << "Front element is: \"" << q.front() << "\"" << endl; // -> "first_in"
        cout << "Back element is: \"" << q.back() << "\"" << endl;   // -> "third_in"
        // We can modify the elements via the references
        q.back() = "last_in";
        cout << "Back element after modification: \"" << q.back() << "\"" << endl;
    }
    
    // --- More Modifiers ---
    // 7. pop(): Removes the element from the FRONT of the queue.
    // IMPORTANT: It has a void return type. It does not return the element.
    q.pop(); // Removes "first_in"
    
    cout << "\nAfter one pop, the new front element is: \"" << q.front() << "\"" << endl; // -> "second_in"
    
    // The correct sequence to get and remove an element:
    string value = q.front();
    q.pop();
    cout << "Correctly retrieved and removed \"" << value << "\"" << endl;
    cout << "Final front element: \"" << q.front() << "\"" << endl; // -> "last_in"
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Iterators and Algorithms

Just like `std::stack`, `std::queue` **does not provide iterators**. This is a deliberate design choice to enforce the FIFO access pattern.

  * You cannot use a range-based `for` loop.
  * You cannot inspect, add, or remove elements from the middle.

To process all items, you must do so in FIFO order by repeatedly accessing `front()` and calling `pop()` until the queue is `empty()`.

-----

#### Example: Processing a Task Queue

A queue is the natural data structure for managing a list of tasks that need to be completed in the order they were submitted.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

struct Task {
    int id;
    std::string data;
};

void process_tasks(std::queue<Task>& tasks) {
    std::cout << "Starting task processing..." << std::endl;
    while (!tasks.empty()) {
        // 1. Get the next task from the front
        Task current_task = tasks.front();
        
        // 2. Remove it from the queue
        tasks.pop();
        
        // 3. Process the task
        std::cout << "Processing Task #" << current_task.id 
                  << " with data: \"" << current_task.data << "\"" << std::endl;
                  
        // Simulate work
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));
    }
    std::cout << "All tasks processed." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "--- Example: Task Processor ---" << std::endl;
    
    std::queue<Task> task_queue;
    
    // Add tasks to the queue
    task_queue.push({1, "Load data"});
    task_queue.push({2, "Compute statistics"});
    task_queue.push({3, "Generate report"});
    task_queue.push({4, "Send notification"});
    
    std::cout << "There are " << task_queue.size() << " tasks in the queue." << std::endl;
    
    process_tasks(task_queue);
    
    std::cout << "Queue is now empty? " << std::boolalpha << task_queue.empty() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use `std::queue` to Enforce FIFO:** When your algorithm's logic requires a strict first-in, first-out policy (e.g., breadth-first searches, message queues, simple schedulers), use `std::queue`. It makes your code's intent unambiguous and safe.
  * **Always Check `!empty()`:** Before calling `front()`, `back()`, or `pop()`, you must verify that the queue is not empty to prevent undefined behavior.
  * **Remember the `front()`/`pop()` Two-Step:** `pop()` is a `void` function. To retrieve and remove the next element, you must first access it with `front()`, and *then* remove it with `pop()`.
  * **`std::deque` is the Right Default:** The default underlying container, `std::deque`, is almost always the best choice for `std::queue`. It is specifically optimized for the front-and-back operations that a queue requires.
  * **FIFO or Nothing:** If you need to access elements other than the front or back, a `queue` is the wrong abstraction. Use `std::deque` or `std::list` directly.

-----

`std::queue` provides a clean, safe, and expressive way to manage data according to a FIFO discipline, a fundamental pattern in computer science.

We have now covered the two primary access-pattern adaptors. We will conclude our tour with the final adaptor, `std::priority_queue`, which breaks the LIFO/FIFO pattern and instead provides access based on element priority.

Of course. Let's complete our tour of the STL with the final, and perhaps most specialized, container adaptor: `std::priority_queue`.

This adaptor breaks away from the simple LIFO/FIFO patterns of `stack` and `queue`. Instead, it organizes elements based on priority, ensuring that the most "important" element is always ready to be accessed.

### `std::priority_queue` - The Highest-Priority-Out Adaptor

#### Introduction

`std::priority_queue` is a container adaptor that provides a queue-like interface, but with a crucial twist: the element that is removed (`pop`) is not necessarily the first one that was added, but rather the one with the highest priority.

  * **Purpose:** To provide a data structure that can efficiently maintain a collection of items and always provide instant access to the item with the highest priority. It is fundamental to many algorithms, including Dijkstra's shortest path, A\* search, Huffman coding, and event-driven simulations.
  * **Heap-Based Implementation:** Conceptually, a `priority_queue` is a **heap**. A heap is a tree-based data structure where the parent node has a higher priority than its children. This structure can be very efficiently implemented using a random-access container like `std::vector`.
  * **Max-Heap by Default:** By default, `std::priority_queue` is a **max-heap**. This means the largest element (as determined by `operator<`) is considered the highest priority and will always be at the `top()`. You can provide a custom comparator to change this behavior (e.g., to create a min-heap).
  * **Restricted Interface:** Like other adaptors, its interface is limited. You can `push` an element (which gets placed according to its priority), inspect the `top` element (the one with the highest priority), and `pop` it. You cannot iterate through the elements, as their internal order is a partial heap order, not a fully sorted sequence.
  * **Underlying Container:**
      * By default, `std::priority_queue` uses `std::vector` as its underlying container.
      * You can also use `std::deque`.
      * The container must provide random-access iterators to be compatible with the standard heap algorithms used internally. `std::list` cannot be used.
  * **Time Complexities:** The complexities are those of heap operations.
      * **`push()`:** $O(\\log N)$ - An element is added to the end and then "sifted up" to its correct position.
      * **`pop()`:** $O(\\log N)$ - The top element is removed, the last element is moved to the top, and then "sifted down" to restore the heap property.
      * **`top()`:** $O(1)$ - Accessing the highest-priority element is a constant-time operation.

-----

#### Header and Syntax

`std::priority_queue` is defined in the `<queue>` header.

**Syntax:** `std::priority_queue<T, Container, Compare> pq_name;`

  * `T`: The type of elements.
  * `Container`: The underlying container. Defaults to `std::vector<T>`.
  * `Compare`: The comparison function object that defines priority. Defaults to `std::less<T>`, which results in a max-heap.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue> // priority_queue is in the <queue> header
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <functional> // For std::greater

int main() {
    // A max-priority_queue of integers (default)
    // Largest element will be on top.
    std::priority_queue<int> max_pq;

    // A min-priority_queue of integers
    // To get a min-heap, we must provide the container and the comparator.
    // Smallest element will be on top.
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> min_pq;
    
    std::cout << "Successfully declared std::priority_queue objects." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### Constructors and Initialization

A priority queue can be created empty or initialized from a range of elements, which will be efficiently converted into a heap.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Constructors and Initialization ---" << endl;

    // 1. Default Constructor (creates an empty max-heap)
    priority_queue<int> pq1;
    pq1.push(10);
    pq1.push(30);
    pq1.push(20);
    cout << "Top of pq1 (max-heap): " << pq1.top() << endl; // -> 30

    // 2. Range Constructor
    // Initializes the heap from a range of elements in O(N) time.
    vector<int> v = {10, 50, 20, 40, 30};
    priority_queue<int> pq2(v.begin(), v.end());
    cout << "Top of pq2 (initialized from vector): " << pq2.top() << endl; // -> 50

    // 3. Constructor with a custom comparator (for a min-heap)
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> min_pq(v.begin(), v.end());
    cout << "Top of min_pq (min-heap): " << min_pq.top() << endl; // -> 10

    return 0;
}
```

-----

#### All Member Functions and Methods

The interface is very similar to `std::stack`, focusing only on the top element.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Member Functions ---" << endl;
    
    priority_queue<string> pq;
    
    // 1. empty() and size()
    cout << "Is priority_queue empty initially? " << boolalpha << pq.empty() << endl;
    
    // --- Modifiers ---
    // 2. push(): Adds an element, maintaining the heap order. O(log N)
    pq.push("banana");
    pq.push("apple");
    pq.push("date");
    
    // 3. emplace() (C++11): Constructs an element in-place. O(log N)
    pq.emplace("cherry");

    cout << "Size of priority_queue: " << pq.size() << endl;
    
    // --- Element Access ---
    // 4. top(): Returns a const reference to the highest-priority element. O(1)
    // Calling top() on an empty priority_queue is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.
    if (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << "Top element (highest priority) is: \"" << pq.top() << "\"" << endl; // -> "date"
    }
    
    // --- More Modifiers ---
    // 5. pop(): Removes the highest-priority element. O(log N)
    // It has a void return type.
    pq.pop(); // Removes "date"
    
    cout << "\nAfter one pop, the new top element is: \"" << pq.top() << "\"" << endl; // -> "cherry"
    
    // The correct sequence to get and remove the top element:
    cout << "\nProcessing all elements in priority order:" << endl;
    while(!pq.empty()) {
        string value = pq.top(); // Get the top element
        pq.pop();                // Remove it
        cout << "  Processed: " << value << endl;
    }
    
    cout << "Priority_queue is now empty? " << boolalpha << pq.empty() << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example: Custom Types and Comparators

To use a custom type in a `priority_queue`, you must provide a way to compare elements. You can do this by overloading `operator<` (for the default `std::less` comparator) or by providing a custom comparator functor.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Task {
    int priority;
    std::string name;
    
    // To work with the default std::less, we define operator<
    // This will create a max-heap based on priority.
    // Task A < Task B means A has lower priority than B.
    bool operator<(const Task& other) const {
        return priority < other.priority;
    }
};

// A custom comparator functor to create a min-heap of Tasks
// We want the task with the smallest priority value to be at the top.
struct MinTaskComparator {
    bool operator()(const Task& a, const Task& b) const {
        return a.priority > b.priority;
    }
};


int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "--- Example: Custom Task Priority Queue ---" << endl;
    
    // 1. Using the default max-heap (via overloaded operator<)
    priority_queue<Task> max_tasks;
    max_tasks.push({10, "Low priority task"});
    max_tasks.push({30, "High priority task"});
    max_tasks.push({20, "Medium priority task"});
    
    cout << "Processing tasks from MAX priority_queue:" << endl;
    while(!max_tasks.empty()) {
        cout << "  - Task: " << max_tasks.top().name 
             << " (Priority: " << max_tasks.top().priority << ")" << endl;
        max_tasks.pop();
    }

    // 2. Using a custom comparator for a min-heap
    priority_queue<Task, vector<Task>, MinTaskComparator> min_tasks;
    min_tasks.push({10, "Low priority task"});
    min_tasks.push({30, "High priority task"});
    min_tasks.push({20, "Medium priority task"});
    
    cout << "\nProcessing tasks from MIN priority_queue:" << endl;
    while(!min_tasks.empty()) {
        cout << "  - Task: " << min_tasks.top().name 
             << " (Priority: " << min_tasks.top().priority << ")" << endl;
        min_tasks.pop();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Best Practices and Tips

  * **Use for Priority-Based Processing:** `priority_queue` is the perfect tool for any algorithm where you repeatedly need to access and remove the "best" or "most important" item from a dynamic collection.
  * **Master Max vs. Min Heaps:** This is the most common point of confusion.
      * **Max-Heap (default):** `std::priority_queue<T>` uses `std::less<T>`. The largest element is at the top.
      * **Min-Heap:** `std::priority_queue<T, vector<T>, std::greater<T>>`. The smallest element is at the top.
  * **Comparator Logic:** The comparison `Compare(a, b)` should return `true` if `a` is considered to have a *lower priority* than `b`. The element that is "less than" others according to this logic sinks, while the "greatest" element rises to the top.
  * **No Iteration:** Like the other adaptors, you cannot iterate through a `priority_queue`. If you need to inspect elements other than the top one, you likely need a `std::multiset` or another container.
  * **Always Check `!empty()`:** Before calling `top()` or `pop()`, ensure the `priority_queue` is not empty to avoid undefined behavior.

### Series Conclusion

Congratulations\! We have journeyed through the entire collection of C++ Standard Template Library containers and adaptors.

  * We started with the basic **sequential containers**, learning the trade-offs between `std::array` (fixed-size), `std::vector` (dynamic contiguous array), `std::deque` (double-ended queue), and the node-based `std::list` and `std::forward_list`.

  * We then moved to **associative containers**, exploring how `std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::map`, and `std::multimap` use balanced binary search trees to store sorted data for efficient, logarithmic-time lookups.

  * Next, we explored the high-speed, hash-based **unordered associative containers** (`std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multiset`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multimap`), which sacrifice order for incredible average-case constant-time performance.

  * Finally, we covered the **container adaptors** (`std::stack`, `std::queue`, `std::priority_queue`), which provide restricted interfaces to underlying containers to enforce specific access patterns like LIFO, FIFO, and priority-based retrieval.

You now have a comprehensive foundation for choosing the right STL container for any task, understanding its performance characteristics, and using its full API correctly and efficiently. Mastering these tools is a significant step toward becoming a proficient C++ programmer.

We have now reached the end of the planned series, having covered all the primary STL containers and container adaptors from `std::array` to `std::priority_queue`.

Where would you like to continue from here? I'm ready to proceed in any direction you choose. For example, we could:

1.  **Delve into the STL Algorithms Library:** Explore the powerful functions in `<algorithm>` and `<numeric>` like `std::sort`, `std::find_if`, `std::transform`, `std::accumulate`, and many others that operate on the containers we've learned. This is the most natural next step.
2.  **Do a Deeper Dive:** Revisit a specific container to explore more advanced use cases, performance trade-offs, or its interaction with memory.
3.  **Work on a Practical Example:** Tackle a small project or a more complex problem that uses several of these containers and algorithms together.
4.  **Discuss Another C++ Topic:** Explore other areas of the C++ standard library, such as iterators, smart pointers, or multithreading.

Please let me know what you'd like to explore next!
